We \\nreviewed a random sample of 100 \\nclaims . We evaluated compliance \\nwith selected Medicare billing \\nrequirements and submitted these \\nsampled claims and the associated \\nmedical records to an independent \\nmedical review contractor to \\ndetermine whether the services met \\ncoverage, medical necessity, and \\ncoding requirements . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit : \\nHospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. \\nWhat OIG Found \\nHPBC received Medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did \\nnot comply with Medicare requirements . Of the 100 hospice claims in \\nour sample , 60 claims complied with Medicare requirement. However, \\nthe remaining 40 did not comply with the requirements. Specifically , the \\nclinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal illness prognosis (30 claims) , the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed \\n(9 claims) , and services were not supported in the medical record (3 \\nclaims) . The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 \\ndeficiency. \\nImproper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies \\nand procedures were not effective in ensuring the clinical \\ndocumentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, \\nthe appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC \\nreceived at least $ 42.3 million in improper Medicare reimbursement for \\nhospice services . \\nWhat OIG Recommends and HPBC Comments \\nWe recommend that HPBC: (1) refund to the Federal Government the \\nportion of the estimated $42.3 million in Medicare overpayments that \\nare within the 4 -year reopening period; (2) based upon the results o f \\nthis audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return \\noverpayments, in accordance with the 60 -day rule; and (3) strengthen \\nits policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with \\nMedicare requirements. \\nIn written comments on our draft report, HPBC disagreed with our findings and \\nrecommendations.  Specifically, HPBC disagreed with all but 3 of the 40 sample \\nclaims questioned in our report. HBPC asserted that our conclusions were \\ninaccurate or divergent from the clinical facts present in the medical records . \\nHPBC also engaged a statistical expert who challenged the validity of our statistical sampling methodology and the resulting extrapolation. \\nAfter reviewing HPBC’s comments, we maintain that our findings and \\nrecommendations are valid.  We also reviewed HPBC’s statistical expert’s comments and maintain that our statistical methodology and extrapolation are statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC. \\nThe full report can be found at https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/22001001.asp .    \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n TABLE OF CONTENT S \\nINTRODUCTION ............................................................................................................................1 \\nWhy We Did This Audit ....................................................................................................1 \\nObjective ..........................................................................................................................1 \\nBackground ......................................................................................................................1 \\nThe Medicare Program ........................................................................................1 \\nThe Medicare Hospice Benefit .............................................................................1 \\nMedicare Requirements To Identify and Return Overpayments ........................3 \\nHospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. ....................................................................4 \\nHow We Conducted This Audit ........................................................................................4 \\nFINDING S......................................................................................................................................5 \\nTerminal Prognosis Not Supported ..................................................................................5 \\nLevel of Care Not Supported ............................................................................................6 \\nServices Not Supported ...................................................................................................6 \\nRECOMMENDATIONS ..................................................................................................................7 \\nHPBC COMMENTS AND OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL RESPONSE .........................................7 \\nMedicare Requirements Related to Clinical Documentation ..........................................9 \\nHPBC Comments ..................................................................................................9 \\nOffice of Inspector General Response ................................................................. 9 \\nMedical Review Contractor ’s Determinations ................................................................. 10 \\nHPBC Comments ..................................................................................................10 \\nOffice of Inspector Gener al Response ................................................................. 11 \\nOffice of Inspector General Sampling Methodology .......................................................13 \\nHPBC Comments ..................................................................................................13 \\nOffice of Inspector General Response ................................................................. 13 \\nAPPENDICES \\nA: Audit Scope and Methodology ..................................................................................17 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Previous Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits and eval uations found that \\nMedicare inappropriately paid for hospice services that did not meet certain Medicare requirements.\\n1 \\nOBJECTIVE \\nOur objective was to determine whether hospice services provided by Hospice of Palm Beach \\nCounty , Inc. (HPBC ), complied with Medicare requirements. \\nBACKGROUND The Medicare Program Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) established the Medicare program, which provides \\nhealth insurance coverage to people aged 65 and over, people with disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the \\nMedicare program. \\nMedicare Part A, also known as hospital insurance, provides for the coverage of various types of \\nservices, including hospice services.\\n2 CMS contracts with Medicare Administrative Contractors \\n(MACs) to pro cess and pay Medicare hospice claims in four home health and hospice \\njurisdictions . \\nThe Medicare Hospice Benefit \\nTo be eligible to elect Medicare hospice care, a beneficiary must be entitled to Medicare Part A \\nand certified by a physician as being terminally ill (i.e., as having a medical prognosis with a life \\nexpectancy of 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course) .3 Hospice care is palliative \\n(supportive), rather than curative, and includes, among other thing s, nursing care, medical \\nsocial services, hospice aide services, medical supplies, and physician services. The Medicare \\nhospice benefit has four levels of care: (1) routine home care, (2) general inpatient (GIP) care , \\n1 See Appendix B for a list of related OIG reports on Medicare hospice services. \\n2 The Act §§ 1812(a)(4) and (5). \\n3 The Act §§ 1814(a)(7)(A) and 1861(dd)(3)(A) and 42 CFR §§ 418.20 and 418.3. \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Medicare provides an all-\\ninclusive daily payment based upon the level of care .4 \\nBeneficiaries eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit may elect hospice care by filing a signed \\nelection statement with a hospice.5 Upon election, the hospice assumes the responsibility for \\nmedical care of the beneficiary’s terminal illness , and the beneficiary waives all rights to \\nMedicare payment for services that are related to the treatment of the terminal condition or related conditions for the duration of the election, except for services provided by the designated hospice directly or under arra ngements or services of the beneficiary’s attending \\nphysician if the physician is not employed by or receiving compensation from the designated hospice .\\n6 \\nThe hospice must submit a notice of election (NOE) to its MAC within 5 calendar days after the effective date of election.  If the hospice does not submit the NOE to its MAC within the \\nrequired timeframe, Medicare will not cover and pay for days of hospice care from the effective date of election to the date that the NOE was submitted to the MAC .\\n7 \\nBeneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, followed by an \\nunlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods.8 At the start of the initial 90 -day benefit period of \\ncare, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s terminal illness from the \\nhospice medical director or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group9 and \\nthe beneficiary’s attending physician, if any. For s ubsequent benefit periods, a written \\ncertification by only the hospice medical director or the physician member of the hospice \\ninterdisciplinary group is required.10 The initial certification and all subsequent recertifications \\nmust include a brief narrative explanation of the clinical find ings that supports a life expectancy \\n4 42 CFR § 418.302.  For dates of service on or after January 1, 2016, there are two daily payment rates for routine \\nhome care – a higher rate for the first 60 days and a lower rate for days 61 and beyond. 80 Fed.

The physician or nurse practitioner conducting the face -to-face encounter must gather \\nand document clinical finding s to support a life expectancy of 6 months or less.13 \\nEffective for dates of service beginning January 1, 2016, hospices can claim a service intensity \\nadd-on (SIA) payment for direct patient care provided by a registered nurse and/or a social \\nworker to a beneficiary receiving routine home care during the last 7 days of life.14 \\nHospice providers must establish and maintain a clinical record for each hospice patient .15 The \\nrecord must include all services, whether furnished directly or under arrangements made by \\nthe hospice . Clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis \\nof a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course must be filed in the medical record with the written certification of ter minal illness .\\n16 \\nMedicare Requirements To Identify and Return Overpayments \\nOIG believes that this audit report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments. Upon receiving credible information of potential overpayments, providers must exercise reasonable diligence to identify overpayments (i.e., determine receipt of and quantify any \\noverpayments) during a 6 -year lookback period. Providers must report and return any \\nidentified overpayments by the later of (1) 60 days after identifying those overpayments or (2) the date that any corresponding cost report is due (if applicable).  This is known as the \\n60-day rule.\\n17 \\nThe 6 -year lookback period is not limited by OIG’s audit period or restrictions on the \\nGovernment’s ability to reopen claims or co st reports.

Specifically, we evaluated compliance with selected billing \\nrequirements and submitted the se sampled claims and the associated medical records to an \\nindependent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, \\nmedical necessity, and coding requirements . \\nWe conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government \\nauditi ng standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \\nsufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our find ings and conclusions \\nbased on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable \\nbasis for our find ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. \\nAppendix A contains the de scribes our audit scope and methodology, Appendix C describes our \\nstatistical sampling methodology, and Appendix D contains our sample results and estimates . \\n18 42 CFR §§ 401.305(d), 405.980(c)(4), and 413.24(f); CMS’ Provider Reimbursement Manual, Pub. 15 -1-\\nPart 1 , § 2931.2; and 81 Fed. Reg. at 7670. \\n19 HPBC is one of three hospices operated by Trustbridge , a nonprofit organization that offers hospice and \\npalliative services throughout Florida’s Broward and Palm Beach counties. \\n20 Claims data for the period April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019, was the most current data available when we \\nstarted our audit. \\n21 In developing this sampling frame, we included hospice claims for which a payment was made from the \\nMedicare Trust Fund and claims that were not identified in the Recovery Audit Contractor data warehouse as \\nhaving been reviewed by another party. \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Of the 100 hospice claims in our sample, 6 0 claims complied with \\nrequirements, but 40 did not. Specifically: \\n• For 30 claims, the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal prognosis. \\n• For nine claims, the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed for \\nMedicare reimbursement. \\n• For three claims, the medical record did not support services claimed for SIA \\npayment s.22 \\nImproper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies and procedures were not \\neffective in ensur ing the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness \\nprognosis, t he appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . \\nOn the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42.3 million in \\nimproper Medicare reimbursement for hospice services.23 As of the publication of this report, \\nthis unallowable amount includes claims outside the 4 -year reopening period .24 \\nNotwithstanding, HPBC can request that a Medicare contractor reopen the initial \\ndeterminations for those claims for the purpose of reporting and returning overpayments under the 60 -day rule without being limited by the 4 -year reopening period .\\n25 \\nTERMINAL PROGNOSIS NOT SUPPORTED \\nTo be eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit, a beneficiary must be c ertified as being \\nterminally ill. Beneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, \\nfollowed by an unlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods. At the start of the initial 90 -day \\nbenefit period of care, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s \\nterminal illness from the hospice medical director or the phy sician member of the hospice \\ninterdisciplinary group and the individual’s attending physician, if any. For subsequent benefit \\nperiods, a written certification from the hospice medical director or the physician member of \\n22 The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. \\n23 Specifically, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42,336,162 in overpayments. To be conservative, we \\nrecommend recovery of overpayments at the lower limit of a two -sided 90- percent confidence interval.

Specifically, HPBC disagreed with \\n31 80 Fed. Reg. 47142, 47175 (Aug. 6, 2015). See also, CMS’s Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Pub. 100- 04, \\nchapter 11, § 30.2.2. \\n32 OIG audit recommendations do not represent final determinations by Medicare.  CMS, acting through a MAC or \\nother co ntracto r, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its \\npolicies and procedures.  Providers have the right to appeal those determinations and should familiarize \\nthemselves with the rules pertaining to when o verpaym ents must be returned or are subject to offset while an \\nappeal is pending.  The Medicare Part A and Part B appeals process has five levels (42 CFR § 405.904(a)(2)), and if a \\nprovider exercises its right to an appeal, the provider does not need to return overpayments until after the second level of appeal.  Potential overpayments identified in OIG reports that are based on extrapolation may be re -\\nestimated depending on CMS determinations and the outcome of appeals. \\n33 This recommendation does not apply to any overpayments that are both within our sampling frame (i.e., the \\npopulation from which we selected our statistical sample) and refunded based upon the extrapolated \\noverpayment amount.  Those overpayments are already covered in the previous recommendation. \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

HPBC also did \\nnot agree with our recommendation to strengthen its policies and procedures because it \\nbelieves it has robust policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements.  However, HPBC did state that it will continue to routinely review and \\nupdate its policies to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws. \\nHPBC asserted that OIG’s audit is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects and, as a result, \\nOIG’s overpayment determinations are invalid . Specifically, HPBC believed that the clinical \\ndocumentation it submitted for the sample claims met Medicare requirements and that OIG’s medical review contractor’s denials were inconsistent with hospice regulations and guidance. \\nHPBC contended that the medical review contr actor ignored patients’ overall medical \\ncondition, focused on irrelevant points, and “cherry -picked” information that resulted in \\nmisleading, incomplete, and inaccurate conclusions. \\nHPBC further argued that statistical extrapolation was an inappropriate tool to utilize for the \\nevaluation of hospice services because of the individualized nature of each patient’s clinical \\nprofile and the subjective and inexact nature of a physician’s level of care determinations (prognostication).  HPBC engaged a statistical expert, who evaluated OIG’s sampling and \\nextrapolation methodologies, and claimed in a report that, even if extrapolation was \\nappropriate, OIG’s sampling and extrapolation were not statistically valid. Lastly , HPBC stated \\nthat the SIA related overpayments found in our sample cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated overpayment amount. \\nHPBC also contended that sections 1870 and 1879 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged \\noverpayments, even if the associated beneficiaries were not terminally ill, as long as the \\nprovider has a reasonable basis for assuming the claims it submitted were correct.  Accordingly, HPBC stated that the overpayments identified by OIG should be waived because HPBC relied on \\nthe clinical judgments of the benefi ciaries’ certifying physicians; therefore, HPBC had a \\nreasonable basis to believe the Medicare payments were correct. \\nHPBC also stated that OIG’s overpayment must be reduced to offset amounts for items and \\nservices (e.g., durable medical equipment, phar maceuticals, and supplies ) that would otherwise \\nbe payable by Medicare had the beneficiary not elected hospice. We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We also reviewed the report \\nprepared by HPBC ’s statistical expert and maintain that our sampling methodology and \\nextrapolation were statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC . However, we note that OIG audit \\n34 Accordingly, HPBC does not believe it was overpaid for hospice services except for three claims for which it \\nagreed that it received excess SIA payments in error.  HPBC state d that it can quantify and will refund all SIA-\\nrelated overpayments in the sampl ing frame; therefore, they state these claims cannot be included in the \\nprojected disallowance. \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

HPBC ’s comments are included as \\nAppendix E.\\n35 \\nMEDICARE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION HPBC Comments \\nHPBC engaged an independent physician to analyze OIG’s m edical review contractor’s findings \\nand conclusions .  According to HPBC, t he physician confirmed that the certifications of terminal \\nillness and levels of care for beneficiaries associated with our sa mple claims were supported by \\nmedical records. Specifically, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor’s analyses were \\nnot supported by the medical records, contained factual errors, and failed to apply \\nfundamental principles or cite relevant medical literature.  Further, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor used similar boilerplate language in its determination letters, which HPBC asserted was an indication of the contractor’s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and to thoroughly review the associated medical records. HPBC also \\nclaimed that the medical review contractor “ cherry -picked ” discrete bits of information to \\nsupport its decisions while disregarding other facts in the record that supported the beneficiaries’ terminal prognosis. Lastly, HPBC argued that the medical review process was flawed because it only included a review of 1 month of records (or less) for each hospice patient, which does not provide a complete medical picture of a beneficiary’s condition. \\nOffice of Inspector General Response \\nWe maintain that the clinical records submitted by HPBC for the sample claims questioned in \\nour draft report did not meet Medicare requirements. Despite using boilerplate language, t he \\nindependent medical review contractor properly used the appropriate statutory and regulatory hospice criteria, including applicable Local Coverage Determination (LCD) guidelines, as the \\nframework for its determinations.  Specifically, the medical review contractor applied standards set out in 42 C FR § 418.22(b)(2), which require clinical information and other documentation \\nthat support the medical prognosis to accompany the certification and be filed in the med ical \\n35 HPBC included multiple exhibits as part of its comments.  These exhibits includ ed a statement by the physician \\nengaged by the hospice, the engaged physician’s curricula vitae, a claim -by-claim rebuttal of the findings in our \\ndraft report, its statistical expert’s report on our sampling methodology , and the statistical expert’s curricula vitae. \\nAlthough the exhibits are not included as appendices in our final report, we considered the entirety of these \\ndocuments in preparing our final report and will provide HPBC’s comments in their entirety to CMS. \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 9          \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n       \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   record. The contractor did not cite medical literature because it audited to Medicare \\nrequirements and medical literature is not considered a Medicare requirement . Further, \\ncontrary to HPBC’s assertion , the medical review contractor did not review o nly 1 month ’s \\nworth of records (or less) for each hospice patient or “cherry -pick” information .  Rather, the \\ncontractor evaluated the entire medical record provided by the hospice for each sample claim \\nto determine whether Medicare requirements were met. This included, but was not limited to, \\nhospice election records; the initial certification of terminal illness; recertifications that covered the sample claim; plans of care ; medication records; physician, nurse, hospice aide , and social \\nworker notes; hosp ital medical records (if applicable) ; and billing documents .  When the \\nmedical records and other available clinical factors supported the physician’s medical prognosis or the level of hospice care provided, the medical review contractor determined that Medicare \\nrequirements were met. \\nMEDI CAL REVIEW CONTRACTOR ’S DETERMINATIONS \\nHPBC Comments HPBC asserted th at the independent medical review contractor failed to apply many well-\\nestablished hospice principles and the appropriate standards governing hospice eligibility. \\nSpecifically, HPBC stated that it was improper for the medical review contractor to deny a claim \\nsolely on the basis that there was no decline in the beneficiary’s medical condition or because \\nthe beneficiary showed improvement. HPBC further alleged that t he cont ractor’s \\ndetermination s were made using the benefit of hindsight and not on the information known at \\nthe time the care was provided.  In addition, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor \\ndenied hospice benefits because the contractor relied on a predetermined list of clinical benchmarks that are not required to support a terminal prognosis.  Further, HPBC claimed that \\nthe medical review contactor relied on LCDs to determine whether a beneficiary met hospice \\neligibility requirements and that it improperly denied a claim when the ben eficiary’s condition \\ndid not meet an LCD. As examples, HPBC described four sample claims (numbers 8, 9, 72, and \\n78) for which it believed the associated beneficiaries’ certifications of terminal illness and levels \\nof care were supported by medical records but were considered unallowable by the independent medical review contractor.\\n36 \\nLastly, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor failed to apply the law consistent with the 2019 Unite d States v. AseraCare , Inc. decision.\\n37 According to HPBC, AseraCare states that \\n“a certifying hospice physician’s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit” and that “medical record supporting a physician’s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment.” \\n36 In exhibits attached to its comme nts, HPBC included what it described as “Patient Response Summaries” \\nrebutting the claims denied or partially denied by the independent medical review contractor. \\n37 938 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2019). \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

As previously mentioned, the medical review contractor appropriately applied the standards set out in 42 CFR § 418.22(b)(2) to determine whether terminal prognosis \\nwas supported.  In those determinations, the contr actor considered the certifying physician’s \\nterminal diagnosis, as well the medical records provided by the hospice for each sample claim, guided by questions rooted in the Medicare requirements and the clinical knowledge of a licensed physician who specializes in hospice and palliative medicine and is familiar with Medicare hospice guidelines and protocols. \\nThe medical review contractor did not deny a claim because there was no decline in the \\nassociated beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement. \\nRather, it evaluated all clinical conditions presented in the medical records collectively to obtain \\nan overall clinical picture of the beneficiary and, based on the information that was available \\nand known at the time of certification or recertification, determined whether hospice eligibility \\nrequirements were met .  We acknowledge that hospice care may still be appropriate for some \\nbeneficiaries who did not meet guidelines detailed in LCDs, based upon an individual \\nassessment of the beneficiaries’ health status.  Accordingly, the independent medical review \\ncontactor merely used LCD guidelines as a tool to evaluate terminal prognosis.  Finally, it was the opinion of OIG’s medical reviewer contractor that the documentation in the m edical \\nrecords did not always support the terminal prognosis. \\nRegarding the four sample claims that HPBC described in its comments as incorrectly \\ndetermined to be unallowable, we note that the independent medical review contractor \\ndetermined that the associated medical records did not support the terminal prognosis or the \\nneed for the level of hospice care provided. Therefore, we mai ntain that the medical review \\ncontractor consistently and appropriately applied Medicare hospice eligibility requirements. Specifically: \\n• Sample claim number 8: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had numerous \\nprognos es that impact ed comorbid and secondary conditions , as well as unintentional \\nweight loss. However, the independent medical review contractor determined that \\nthere was no documentation of secondary conditions38 and that the beneficiary had \\ngained weight since admission.  Therefore, the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months \\nwas not supported. \\n• Sample claim number 9: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had several \\ncomorbid and secondary conditions that contribut ed to her terminal prognosis and that \\nshe lost 10.4 percent of her body weight in under 2 months.  However, the independent \\n38 Such as stage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis . \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Therefore, the terminal \\nprognosis of less than 6 months was not supported. \\n• Sample claim number 72: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary required a higher \\nlevel of care due to labored breathing and elevated heart rate in addition to frequent \\nmedication interventions and adjustments to control her pain.  However, the medical \\nreview contractor determined that although the medical file documented that the \\nbeneficiary was imminently dying and unresponsive, the symptoms were being well \\ncontrolled on scheduled subcutaneous (i.e., not intravenous) doses of morphine. The \\nbeneficiary was not in crisis ; therefore, the predominance of services provided d id not \\nrequire nursing support.  As a result, the continuous home care services provided was \\nnot required . \\n• Sample claim number 78: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary’s unstable \\nmedical condition and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure required around -the-clock \\nmonitoring by a nurse and frequent administration of several intravenous medication s.  \\nHowever, the medical review contractor determined the beneficiary’s medical condition did not warrant a short -term inpatient stay for pain control or ac ute or chronic symptom \\nmanagement that could not feasibly be provided in other settings. Specifically, t he \\nmedical file did not document that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered.  Rather, medication was administered \\nsubcutaneously , which does not require an inpatient setting.  Therefore, the general \\ninpatient care services provided were not required. \\nIn addition to its exhibits , which include d a claim- by-claim rebuttal, HPBC’s comments included \\nseveral examples that, according to HPBC, demonstrate that the medical review contractor \\nimproperly denied claims because beneficiaries’ conditions had not declined or their conditions \\nhad improved or st abilized .  HPBC stated that the contractor did not base the ir determinations \\nfrom the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. For these examples, we \\nmaintain that the medical review contractor determin ed that the associated medical f ile did not \\nsupport a terminal prognosis of 6 months or less or that the level of care provided was \\nrequired .  \\nFor example, for sample claim number 58, HPBC state d that the medical review contractor \\ndenied hospice eligibility for a 90 -year -old beneficiary who weighed 100 pounds but began to \\neat all of her meals because she was given an appetite stimulate despite having a primary diagnosis of cerebral atherosclerosis (i.e., a neurological condition) for which the LCD does not requir e any weight loss or poor appetite.  Further, the medical review contractor noted that \\nthere was no evidence of significant decline.  However, we note that the medical review \\ncontractor also determined that the there was no documentation of secondary condi tions (e.g., \\nstage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis ).  In addition, \\nthe beneficiary was alert and the documentation supported improved and healing of a stage 2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Therefore, the medical review contractor determined that the medical file did \\nnot support a prognosis of 6 months or less. \\nWe also disagree with HPBC’ s AseraCare -based assertion that the eligibility determination can \\nbe questioned only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded that the patient was \\neligible for the hospice benefit. To the contrary, in AseraCare , the Eleventh Circuit rejected the \\nGovernment’s concern that, under the court’s reading of the eligibility framework, if a physician \\ncertified a patient as terminally ill, CMS would be required to reimburse the hospice provider unless CMS could determine that no other reviewer could possibly conclude the patient was terminally ill.\\n39 Although th e AseraCare case was about the circumstances under which \\ncertifications of terminal illness could be deemed false for purposes of Federal False Claims Act liability, the Eleventh Circuit clearly acknowledged that CMS is statutorily prohibited from paying f or services that are not reasonable and necessary for the palliation or management of \\nterminal illness and that CMS retains a well- established right to review and deny payments for \\nclaims that do not meet that standard. Accordingly, we maintain the validity of our findings . \\nOFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL SAMPLING METHODOLOGY \\nHPBC Comments \\nHPBC challenged the validity of our statistical sampling and extrapolation methodologies, \\nengaged a statistical expert to review OIG’s sampling methodology, and pr ovided a copy of the \\nstatistical expert’s re port. HPBC stated that extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating \\noverpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication. HPBC \\nalso stated that OIG’s statistical methodolo gy was fundamentally flawed and the extrapolated \\noverpayment amount is statistically invalid. According to HPBC ’s statistical expert: (1) OIG did \\nnot provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample, (2) OIG’s sample size was too small to yield an accurate estimate of a two-sided 90 -percent confidence \\ninterval and standard precision of 10 percent, (3) the sample units w ere not statistically \\nindependent because OIG sample d by claim— not b y beneficiary or episode of care, (4) OIG \\nimproperly excluded zero -paid claims from its universe, and (5) the payment error rate is not \\nhigh enough to permit the use of extrapolatio n.  Lastly, HPBC stated that the SIA payments \\nidentified as unsupported in o ur draft report were due to a Palmetto system error as well as an \\nelectronic medical record (EMR) system error. HPBC stated that it can quantify total SIA \\noverpayment s in the sampling frame through a case -by-case review; therefore, OIG is not \\npermitted to use sampling to estimate this amount. \\nOffice of Inspector General Response \\nAfter reviewing the statistical expert’s report, we maintain that our sampling and extrapolation \\nmethodologies are statistically valid.  Federal courts have consistently upheld statistical \\n39 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1295 . \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

The conservative nature of our estimate is not c hanged by the \\nnature of the errors identified in this audit. Moreover, the court cases that HPBC ’s attorney \\nreferenced in support of the proposition that extrapolation is inappropriate for individualized prognostication in hospices\\n42 are limited to False Claims Act cases and therefore are \\ninapplicable to OIG audit recommendations and CMS recoveries arising from OIG audits. \\nThe statistical expert’s claim that OIG did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the \\nsampling frame or the sample is not c orrect.

(\"HPBC\") appreciates the opportunity to provide \\ncomments in response to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \\nInspector General\\'s (\"OIG\\'s\") draft report entitled Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance \\nAudit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (\"Draft Report\"). HPBC\\'s comments to the Draft \\nReport, including the report\\'s conclusions and recommendations , are set forth below.1 \\nINTRODUCTION \\nHPBC is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in Florida, having been established in 1978 \\nby communit y leaders to provide end-of-life care for the area\\'s aging population. Its long\\xad\\ntenured leadership team has over 100 years in combined hospice experience. HPBC is one of the \\noldest non-profit hospices in Florida, and it was also one of the first 100 hospices to become \\nMedicare-certified. It has also earned The Joint Commiss ion accreditation for meeting the \\nhighest performance standards of care, and it created a nationally-r ecognized Hospice and \\nPalliative Medicine Fellowship Program for physicians wishing to specialize in hospice care. \\n1 This letter and Exhibits 1-2 and 40-41 do not include any protected health information (\"PHI\\'\\'), and therefore we \\nask that they be attached as an appendix to the OIG\\'s final audit report once it is made public. Exhibits 3-39 do \\ncontain PHI, and we ask that these exhibits not be included within the publicly available version of the OIG\\'s final \\naudit report. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 APPENDIX E: HPBC COMMENTS \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 23      BLACKWELL \\nMs. Brenda Tierney \\nJuly 12, 2022 \\nPage 2 \\nFrom a review of only 0.269%2 of the claims for payment that this non-profit hospice \\nsubmitted to Medicare over a two-year period, the OIG has concluded that it received an alleged \\noverpayment of $42,336,162. This conclusion is based on a review of limited patient medical \\nrecords by a Medical Review Contractor retained by the OIG to assess whether HPBC admitted \\npatients who qualified for hospice, i.e., had a medical prognosis that his or her life expectanc y is \\nsix months or less if the illness runs its normal course, and whether those patients were afforded \\nthe appropriate level of care. But, the Medical Review Contractor failed to adhere to the law and \\nstandards of practice when reviewing HPBC\\'s claims, and many of its summaries contain factual \\nerrors. \\nIn response to this Draft Report, HPBC engaged an independent physician who is well\\xad\\nqualified in hospice medicine to evaluate its patient records and the OIG\\'s Medical Review \\nContractor \\'s assessments of the claims at issue. This independent expert physician has \\nconfirmed that HPBC\\'s patient records supported the reasonable clinical judgments of the HPBC \\nphysicians who certified that the patients at issue were eligible for hospice and who determined \\neach patient\\'s appropriate level of hospice care. Significantly, as with other hospice physicians \\nreviewing similar OIG audits, this physician has expressed concern over the apparent lack of \\nunderstanding of hospice medicine reflected in the Medical Review Contractor \\'s assessments. \\nThe Contractor \\'s assessments are misleading, incomplete, focus on irrelevant data points, and, \\nmost importantl y, fail to provide any explanation regarding how those data points relate to each \\npatient\\'s prognosis. As detailed in these comments, the Medical Review Contractor clearly \\ndisregarded numerous hospice principles set out in CMS guidance documents . It is our \\nunderstanding the OIG has not independently requested from, nor verified, proof of the \\nqualifications of the physicians or clinicians used by its Medical Review Contractor to review \\nhospice claims. \\nThe OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor also failed to apply the appropriate standards for \\nassessing patient eligibility established by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in \\nUnited States v. AseraCare, Jnc.3 Specifically, theAseraCare court explained that a certifying \\nhospice physician\\'s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only ifno reasonable \\nphysician , applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was \\neligible for the Medicare hospice benefit.4 Nothing within the Medical Review Contractor\\'s \\ndecisions make this necessary showing. Rather, the Medical Review Contractor merely cherry\\xad\\npicked discrete bits of information to rationalize its decisions while ignoring the patients\\' overall \\n2 The OIG reviewed 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims for 1,556 patients cared for by HPBC from April 1, 2017 to \\nMarch 31, 2019. Of the 100 claims reviewed, the OIG has alleged an overpayment with respect to 40 of those \\nclaims, which totaled $148,856. \\n3 938 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2019) \\n4 AlthoughAseraCare arose under the False Claims Act, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in its decision that its \\n\"primary task on appeal [was] to clarify the scope of the hospice eligibility requirements, which are set out in the \\nfederal Medicare statute\" and its implementing regulations. Id at 1291. Accordingly, this standard governs all \\napplications of the Medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations, including applications in OIG\\'s audit, and is \\nnot limited to False Claims Act cases. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Contrary to AseraCare, the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor failed to \\ngive any deference to the certifying hospice physicians, resulting in the unsupported conclusion \\nthat the clinical judgments made by more than 28 different hospice physicians, many of whom \\nhave over a decade ( or two) of hospice experience, are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative \\nCare Medicine , and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine ,5 \\nwere wrong when certifying these patients, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. 6 This \\nillogical result is possibly explained by the flawed review process. As explained in these \\ncomments , the process used by the OIG to evaluate medical necessity may work well for most \\nMedicare items or services, but it is incompatibl e with hospice services. \\nLikewise , the statistical extrapolation process employed by the OIG to convert its review \\nof less than one-half of one percent of HPBC \\'s claims to an overpayment totaling tens of \\nmillions of dollars is unfounded. Statistical extrapolation is an inappropriate tool to utilize for \\nthe evaluation of the practice of hospice medicine because of the individualized nature of \\nprognostication. Even if ell.1rapolation were appropriate, the sampling and extrapolation in this \\nmatter have been determined by an expert statistician to be invalid for a number of reasons, any \\none of which wan-ants the OIG\\'s reconsideration of its use of the sampling and extrapolation to \\ndetermine the estimated overpayment. \\nThe Social Security Act (\"Act\") also supports waiver of the overpaymen ts in this case \\npursuant to federal law because HPBC submitted the claims at issue in reliance on the clinical \\njudgments of the certifying physicians, which are not shown by the OIG\\'s Medical Review \\nContractor\\'s summaries to be unreasonable. Lastly, the Draft Report does not include a required \\noffset based on items and services for which there is no dispute regarding medical necessity, \\nsuch as durable medical equipment, pharmacy, radiology, and labs that Medicare is required to \\ncover regardless of whether the patient was terminally ill. \\nOverall, the Draft Report will significantly decrease beneficiary access to the hospice \\nbenefit if it is not reconsidered and revised. If hospices and physicians were to use the criteria \\nand standards used by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor, it will mean some of the most \\nvulnerable Medicare beneficiaries will not be able to access hospice care until they are showing \\nsigns and symptoms of actively dying, which is directly contrary to the intent of Congress and \\nCMS. 7 The active dying process occurs over hours or days, whereas the Medicare hospice \\n5 For example, six claims denied by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor are associated with four physicians who \\nhave over 10 years\\' experience and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Two \\nof these physicians also teach hospice medicine.

For these reasons, we respectfully request that the OIG reconsider the claim decisions \\nand the conclusions made in the Draft Report. \\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON HPBC \\nThe Draft Audit Report is wholly inconsistent with HPBC\\'s history, leadership, \\naccreditation, reputation, and culture of compliance. As a historical and locally-based non-profit, \\nwith its sole mission to provide families in the community with access to compassionate and \\nquality hospice services, HPBC has taken all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the \\nMedicare program. \\nHPBC is a non-profit hospice that was originally formed by a group of community \\nleaders in 1978 to provide end-of-life care for everyone who needed it, regardless of their ability \\nto pay or financial status. This was before the Medicare hospice benefit existed. At that time, it \\nwas one of the first hospices in the area. When Medicare created the hospice benefit in 1983, \\nrecognizing the benefits and cost-savings associated with end-of-life care, HPBC became one of \\nthe first 100 hospices to be certified. In 2014, HPBC joined together with its sister-location \\nHospice by the Sea to form Trustbridge, Inc. (formerly known as Spectrum Health, Inc.). \\nTrustbrid ge is currently the largest provider of hospice care in the area. In 2009, HPBC became \\none of the only hospices to earn The Joint Commission \\'s Gold Seal of Approval for Home Care \\nAccreditation, meaning it has met the most rigorous quality and safety standards of care for \\npatients. \\nAs a non-profit corporatio n, HPBC is governed by a Board of Directors, comprised of 10 \\nvolunteers from the local community. The members of the Board of Directors are highly \\ncredentialed and are actively engaged in HPBC\\'s efforts to provide quality care in compliance \\nwith all state and federal laws. The Board is currently chaired by Ms. Barbara Bolton Litten, Esq. \\nMs. Litten has been a business litigation attorney for over 26 years. Prior to becoming an \\nattorney, she was the Chief Executive Officer of a large not-for-profit corporation based in \\nSouthwest Florida. She has been a member of the Board of Directors since 2010. Prior to her \\nbecoming chair, Mr. Randy Levitt served in that capacity. Mr. Levitt is a Senior Vice President \\nat Morgan Stanley and is both a CPA and attorney. He served as chairman from 2017 to 2021 \\nand remains on the Board. Two other members of the board are healthcare regulatory attorneys, \\nMarian Pealman Nease and Heather Miller. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Mr. David Fielding has been the President and Chief \\nExecutive Officer since 1998. Prior to taking this role 24 years ago, Mr. Fielding held leadership \\npositions with two other large hospice companies for 9 years. Dr. Faustino Gonzale z, Chief \\nMedical Officer and Medical Director for HPBC, is board-certified in Internal Medicine with an \\nadded qualification in Hospice & Palliative Medicine. He has also been a Fellow of the \\nAmerican Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine since 2010. He has over 21 years\\' \\nexperience in hospice care, and he has published over 13 peer-review articles and has given more \\nthan a dozen presentations at various conferences and symposiums on end-of-life and palliative \\ncare, including presentations for the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and \\nthe Veterans Administration. \\nHPBC provides exemplary and compliant care to its patients, evidenced by its Gold Seal \\nof Approval for Home Care Accreditation from The Joint Commi ssion, and its survey history. \\nHPBC has been continuousl y accredited by The Joint Commission since 2009. HPBC had no \\ncondition-l evel findings on the last two surveys conducted by The Joint Commission in 2018 and \\n2022. HPBC is also regularly surveyed by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration \\n(AHCA), the agency in Florida that licenses hospices, which is also the state survey agency for \\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). HPBC had no deficiencies \\nrepresenting serious or immediate risk or harm to patients during the time period at issue or after. \\nBecause of its reputation for providing high quality care, HPBC was able to join in a consortium \\nwith the Universit y of Miami Miller School of Medicine , JFK Medical Center, and West Palm \\nBeach Veterans Administration Center to create a Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship \\nprogram. This fellowship program prepares physicians for board-certification in hospice and \\npalliative medicine and was nationally accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate \\nMedical Education in 2010. \\nAs part of a large organization, HPBC has very robust policies and procedures and \\ncorporate compliance plan. The OIG confirmed during its exit interview that it had not identified \\nany particular flaw or problem with these policies and procedures. The Draft Report similarly \\ndoes not identify any specific policy or procedure that is improper or requires modification. \\nRather, the Draft Report generally indicates HPBC\\'s policies and procedures were ineffective, \\ndespite the OIG\\'s own statements there were no particular flaw or problem with the policies.8 \\nHPBC\\'s policies and procedures regarding certification of hospice eligibility are based on the \\nfederal statutes and regulations, requiring that the physician determine the patient\\'s eligibility \\n8 The OIG\\' s position in the Draft Report appears to result from the conclusions of the Medical Review Contractor. \\nIn other words, the OIG has concluded that there must be something wrong with HPBC\\'s policies and procedures \\nbecause the Medical Review Contractor found reason to deny or down-code certain claims. The OIG ignores the \\nmore likely explanation: the Medical Review Contractor denied or down-coded claims because the Medical Review \\nContractor failed to properly apply basic tenets of hospice medicine in a manner consistent with the Medicare \\nhospice benefit. See Exhibit 1, Physician Statement of Dr. Leedy Regarding the OIG\\'s Audit of Hospice of Palm \\nBeach County Inc. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

As required by law, HPBC\\'s policies require the physician to prepare a brief written \\nnarrative reflecting the patient\\'s clinical circumstances justifying the terminal prognosis , and \\nexpressly require that the clinical information supporting the terminal prognosis be documented \\nin the medical record. All of these patients had signed certifications in which their treating \\nphysicians attested that they had a terminal prognosis based on those physicians\\' clinical \\njudgment. Nothing in the policies and procedures encourages or incentivizes physicians or \\nhospice staff to certify ineligible patients for hospice. To the contrary, the policies make clear \\nthat if a patient is ineligible, a more appropriate referral will be made. \\nHPBC has taken steps to implement and ensure compliance with its policies and \\nprocedures through regular education of its Board members, leadership , physicians, and staff. \\nHPBC has a director of excellenc e and knowledge who coordinates for all physicians and staff \\nnecessary training to provide quality care in compliance with the Medicare requirements. During \\nthe time period at issue, the HPBC physicians were required to attend education on \\ninterdisciplinary group meetings and documentation standards, an annual two-part Rapid \\nRegulatory Compliance program through HealthStream, which included corporate compliance; \\nand Relias LLC educational sessions on physician narratives and relatedness determinations. \\nHPBC\\'s other clinical staff also attended the two-part Rapid Regulatory Complianc e program \\nthrough HealthStr eam, sessions on prognosti cation tools and hospice eligibility, and several \\nRelias LLC educational sessions touching on the Medicare hospice benefit and its requirements. \\nPhysicians and staff alike attend training sessions any time HPBC\\'s policies and procedures are \\nupdated. \\nIn addition to this training, HPBC\\'s Complianc e Plan ensures the effectiveness of its \\npolicies, procedures, and practices. HPBC\\'s Compliance Plan is consistent with the OIG\\'s \\nguidance9 and memorializes the commitm ent of HPBC\\'s Board of Directors and all hospice staff \\nto actively participate and uphold the hospice\\'s commitm ent to compliance. Board members and \\nHPBC\\'s leadership attend annual training on the Compliance Plan. There is also a dedicated, \\nfull-time Corporate Compliance Officer, who is supported by a Compliance Department made up \\nof a full-time Director of Compliance and two full-time compliance nurses. In addition to its \\nfull-time Complian ce Officer and Compliance Department , HPBC has a Compliance Steering \\nCommittee, which provides oversight and direction on regulatory requirement s. \\nThe Compliance Department conducts an annual risk assessment, identifying potential \\nareas of risk using internal audit findings as well as governmental guidance and opinions, to \\ndevelop an audit plan. It then conducts internal audits based on this plan and frequentl y engages \\noutside consultants to conduct reviews.

Monthly audit findings are reported to the department \\nstakeholders on a regular basis. During the time period at issue, audits were conducted on the \\nuse of general inpatient (\"GIP\") care for five or more days, crisis care provided for longer than \\nthree days, and patients with a length of stay longer than 180 days. These audits were conducted \\nby pulling a sample on a weekly or bi-monthly basis. Staff counseling and education is \\nconducted if the results reveal a pattern or trend. \\nIn addition to conducting audits based on its annual risk assessment, the Compliance \\nDepartment also conducts investigations based on reports it receives through various sources. \\nAll physicians , staff, and volunteers are provided with a Compliance Hotline number to report \\nconcerns related to compliance. This toll-free Compliance Hotline number is maintained by a \\nthird-party contractor to ensure anonymit y, and it is posted throughout the HPBC offices. The \\nCompliance Department also hosts a \"Complianc e and Ethics Week\" every November, during \\nwhich staff participate in games designed to educate them on the Compliance Plan and where or \\nhow to report compliance concerns, including the Compliance Hotline. All staff members are \\nalso asked to review HPBC\\'s Conflict of Interest/Code of Conduct Policy every year and \\ncomplete an attestation form that asks staff members to disclose compliance-r elated issues. \\nBecause of HPBC\\'s culture emphasizing compliance , most compliance reports are received \\ndirectly by the Corporate Complian ce Officer or Director of Complianc e. A review of the \\nHPBC\\'s reports and internal audits and investigations does not reveal any pattern or systemic \\nproblems with respect to eligibility or level of care determinations.10 \\nThe effectiveness of the hospice\\'s policies and procedur es and Compliance Plan are \\ndemonstrated by CMS \\'s PEPPER reports. PEPPER11 reports provide statistics for key markers \\nused to identify qu estionable billing practices so that hospices may target and improve \\nproblematic areas. The reports include data on live discharges, long lengths of stay, 12 and top \\nfive diagnoses. For the target areas related to certification of potentiall y ineligible patients, \\nHPBC has been far below the percentile that CMS deems a high risk for improper payments (the \\n80th percentile). With respect to long lengths of stay, HPBC \\'s PEPPER repo1i for the three \\nfederal fiscal years through fiscal year 201913 showed that only 10.1 % of its patients had a long \\nlength of stay, putting HPBC in the 19.8 percentile nationwide. This means 80.2% of hospices \\nnationwide had a higher percentage of patients with long lengths of stay as compared to HPBC \\n10 HPBC\\'s culture of compliance is further demonstrated by voluntary repayments made in the past in response to its \\ninternal investigations. On December 22, 2017, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto in the amount of \\n$91,623.83 for evaluation and management services performed by physician, Dr. Randy Fox, which were \\ndetermined to be potential overpayments using a statistically valid random sample. On March 4, 2020, HPBC made \\na voluntary repayment to Pahnetto and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration after determining \\nphysician narratives for two patients were potentially defective. On March 18, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary \\nrepayment to Pahnetto for GIP claims submitted for three patients that were determined to be potential \\noverpayments following an internal investigation that involved detailed chart reviews. \\n11 Program for Evaluating Payment Patterns Electronic Report (\"PEPPER\"). \\ntz Long Length of Stay patients are those whose combined days of service is greater than 180 days. \\n13 For federal fiscal year (\"FY\") 2019 (October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019). \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

In other words, the PEPPER reports reflect HPBC surpassed most other \\nhospices with respect to accurate prognosticati on. \\nHPBC recognize s that, like all providers, it is not infallible. However, its history, \\nleadership, policies and procedures, Compliance Plan, ongoing staff and physician education, \\nand overall culture make it apparent that any issues that occur are aberrant and far from \\nwidespread. The OIG\\'s conclusion to the contrary ignores HPBC\\'s background, policies, and \\nculture and is indicative of an overzealous medical review contractor that appears to lack a clear \\nunderstanding of the hospice standard of practice, as well as the statutes and regulations \\ngoverning hospice. IfOIG\\'s conclusion were correct, it would mean that the clinical judgment \\nof over 28 different certifying physicians , who personally treated the patients and had \\nabsolutely no incentive to improperly admit them for hospice care, was incorrect. Such \\nconclusion lacks credibility when considering the foregoing information. \\nRESPONSE TO THE OIG\\'S DRAFT REPORT \\nI. Swnmary of the Draft Report \\nIn this audit, the OIG reviewed a very narrow snapshot ofHPBC \\'s overall operat ions. As \\na part of its audit, the OIG selected a random sample of 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims \\nsubmitted by HPBC for the time period of April 2017 to March 2019, which represents 0.269% \\nof the claims submitted by HPBC for that time period. The 100 claims selected by the OIG were \\nassociated with only one month (or less) of hospice services provided to 100 different hospice \\npatients. During that time period, HPBC provided hospice care to 12,762 Medicare beneficiaries \\nand received $149,850,136 in Medicare reimbursement. \\nAfter requesting and receiving records from HPBC for these 100 patients for this one \\nmonth or less of service, the OIG then had its Medical Review Contractor review the records. \\nThe OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor determined that 60 of the claims met all Medicare \\nrequirements, while 40 of the claims did not. Of those 40 claims, 30 were denied because the \\nMedical Review Contractor concluded that records accompanying the properly signed physician \\ncertification or recertification did not support the medical prognosis of a terminal illness; 7 were \\ndowncoded from a higher level of care to the routine home care level of care because, although \\nthe patient was clinically eligible for hospice services, the Medical Review Contractor concluded \\nthat the documentation did not support the higher level of care; and three were partially denied \\nbecause the Medical Review Contractor concluded that the service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") \\npayment was not supported.14 \\n14 As a result of the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC learned of an error in its E.MR system that created minor Service Intensity \\nAdd-on (\"SIA\") overpayments for some patients. Due to the nature of the technological issue, HPBC is able to \\nidentify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 30    BLACKWELL \\nMs. Brenda Tierney \\nJuly 12, 2022 \\nPage 9 \\nThe OIG extrapolated the error rate for the sample of claims determined by its Medical \\nReview Contractor to the entire universe of claims submitted by HPBC to Medicare during the \\ntwo-year time frame for this audit. As a result of the extrapolation, the OIG alleges in its Draft \\nReport that HPBC received approximately $42,336,162 in improper payments. Nothing in the \\nDraft Report suggests that HPBC acted fraudulently or that it knowingly submitted incorrect \\ninformation to the government. \\nThe OIG concludes its report by making three recommendations: (1) refund the portion \\nof the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise \\nreasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-\\nday rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply \\nwith Medicare requirements. In the next sections of this letter, HPBC provides its analysis of the \\nDraft Report and then responds to these recommendations. \\nII, Analysis of the OIG\\'s Audit Process and Determinations \\nA. The Clinical Documentation for the Claims Reviewed by the Medical Review \\nContractor Met All Requirements . \\nHPBC provided properly signed and clinically supported physician certifications and \\nrecertifications for each patient whose claim was denied by the Medical Review Contractor. \\nHPBC also provided documentation demonstrating that the patients who received a higher level \\nof hospice care in fact required that level of care. Highly trained and experienced physicians \\nsigned these certifications and made level of care determinations using their clinical judgment, \\nbasing their judgment on the patients\\' conditions. This audit involves rejection of the clinical \\njudgment of over 28 different certifying physicians who personally treated the patients at issue, \\nthe majority of whom were over 90-years-old. Many of these physicians have worked in hospice \\nfor years and are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine. Some of them are \\nFellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, the highest honor that \\ncan be bestowed on a Board-certified hospice physician. Some of them even teach hospice and \\npalliative medicine. Rejecting the clinical judgments of these physicians impugns their expertise \\nand reputation. \\nHPBC engaged an independent physician with impeccable credentials, Dr. Stephen A. \\nLeedy, MD, MA, HMDC, F AAHPM, to further analyze the Medical Review Contractor\\'s \\nfindings and conclusions. 15 Dr. Leedy assessed the medical records that were provided to the \\nOIG and confirmed, as set forth in the individual patient responses included with this letter \\n(\"Patient Response Summarie s\"), 16 that the certifications of terminal illness and the levels of care \\noverpayment amount. Once it has completed this quantifica tion, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Palmetto the \\ntotal SIA overpayment amount. \\n15 See Exhibit 2, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Leedy. \\n16 See Exhibits3-39. These exhibits are comprised ofHPBC\\'sresponses to the bases for the OIG\\'s claim denials. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

These conclusions by Dr. Leedy are \\nsupported by his extensive experience with hospice, as well as peer-reviewed medical literature, \\nto which he cites in the Patient Response Summaries.17 \\nThe Medical Review Contractor\\'s decisions for these patients, on the other hand, are not \\nsupported by the medical records, are rife with factual errors, fail to apply fundamental principles \\nof hospice medicine as recognized by the medical community, and fail to include citation to any \\nrelevant medical literature. The Medical Review Summaries use the same or similar boilerplate \\nlanguage for each claim at issue, which is indicative of the Contractor\\'s failure to apply the \\nappropriate eligibility and level of care standards and thoroughly review the medical records \\nprovided by HPBC. This approach evidences a results-oriented outcome approach in which the \\nContractor cherry-picked discrete bits of information to support its denials while disregarding \\nother facts in the record supporting the patients\\' terminal prognoses. Dr. Leedy has provided a \\nPhysician Statement expressing his deep disappointment and concern over the lack of \\nunderstanding of hospice eligibility reflected in the \"Rationale\" of the Medical Review \\nSummaries.18 In his Physician Statement, Dr. Leedy details how the Contractor\\'s analyses are \\ninconsistent with the standard of practice, undermine the purpose of hospice care, and are \\nantithetical to the hospice benefit. He further describes how the Rationales across patients are \\ncontradictory and downplay or ignore key clinical data in favor of select details cherry-picked \\nfrom the medical records. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s lack of understanding is best shown \\nthrough the following examples: \\n17 Dr. Leedy cited to the following in the Patient Response Summaries: De Stefani, Pietraroia, Fernandes-Silva, et \\nal., Observational Evidence for Unintentional Weight Loss in All-Cause Mortality and Major Cardiovascu lar \\nEvents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis , 8 SCI.

This 92-\\nyear-old patient had a primary diagnosis of senile degeneration of the brain with a \\nFunctional Assessment Staging Tool (\"FAST\") score of7C and a Palliative \\nPerformanc e Scale (\"PPS\") score of only 30%, as well as numerous prognosis\\xad\\nimpacting comorbid and secondary conditions, including osseous defects in her right \\nshoulder and right leg, muscle weakness, and a coccygeal wound. She also required a \\npotent transdermal opioid analgesic for hip and low back pain, and she suffered from \\nanorexia, eating less than 25% of meals. During the denied month of service, she \\nexhibited severe nutritional compromise, and multiple factors documented throughout \\nthe medical record support that she was significantly malnourish ed. Accordingly, Dr. \\nLeedy concluded from his review of the medical record that this patient had a \\nterminal prognosis during these dates of service and was appropriately certified. The \\nContractor provided several irrelevant clinical points to support the unfavorable \\ndecision, many of which indicated a misplaced focus on body mass index (\"BMI\"), \\nwhich is not required to demonstrate hospice eligibility, to the exclusion of other \\ninformation bearing on terminality. Specifically, the Contractor glossed over this \\npatient\\'s unintention al weight loss of 4.6% of her body weight in only 6 weeks, her \\nincreased contractures and kyphosis that made it difficult to measure her height, her \\ndysphagia, and her anorexia that impaired her nutritional intake. In addition to \\nconcluding that this patient was eligible, Dr. Leedy opined that the Contractor \\n\"selectively ignored information in the medical record to reach a misguided \\nconclusion .\" \\n• Sample #9 -The Contractor determined Sample #9, who met the LCD guidelines, \\nwas not eligible for hospice services for dates of service September 29-30, 2017. This \\n78-year-old patient had a primary diagnosis offrontotemporal dementia with a FAST \\nscore of 7 A and several comorbid and secondary conditions contributing to her \\nterminal prognosis. Notably, she had lost 10.4% of her body weight in under 2 \\nmonths and was anorexic and cachectic. The Contractor relied on factually false and \\nimmaterial factors in finding her ineligible. For example, the Contractor noted \"that \\nthere was no documentation of ongoing weight loss,\" which is directly contradicted in \\nthe medical record and would have been apparent had the Contractor not artificially \\nand inappropriately constrained the review to just two days of care. Similarly, despite \\nacknowledging her FAST score of 7 A, which meets the applicable Palmetto LCD \\nguidelines, the Contractor determined this patient to be ineligible, ignoring clinical \\nfactors indicating a progression towards 7C and downplaying the significance of her \\nstaggeringl y low BMI of just 16. Dr. Leedy concluded that this patient was eligible \\nfor hospice services and added that the Contractor \\'s \"woefully inadequate \\nunderstand ing of the details of hospice eligibility, including what appears to be a \\ncomplete lack of reference to LCD guidelines, and evidence of inadequate medical \\nrecord review, calls into questions the validity of the review.\" \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

This 91-year-old patient \\nhad a primary hospice diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease and a PPS score of only \\n10%, meaning she was comatose and not consuming anything by mouth. Dr. Leedy \\nconcluded that she was eligible for CHC services during this three-day period because \\nshe required a higher level of care for the unstable vital signs oftachypnea (labored \\nbreathing) and tachycardia ( elevated heart rate), in addition to frequent medication \\ninterventions and adjustments to control her pain. Notably, she died on the final day \\nof the denied dates of service. Yet, the Contractor commented that the \\n\"documentation does not support that she was in crisis.\" To the contrary, Dr. Leedy\\'s \\nreview of the records revealed \"clear signs of distress, including pain and dyspnea,\" \\nwhich are \"exactly the situation that warrants CHC.\" In fact, the care provided in this \\ncase is \"an exemplar of the successful use of CHC,\" as the patient was able to die \\npeacefully in her own home. \\n• Sample #78 ~ The Contractor determined Sample #78 was not eligible for GIP care \\nfor dates of service September 1-8, 2017. This 81-year-old patient had a primary \\ndiaguosis of acute catastrophic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident and a PPS of \\n20% that further declined to 10% on September 3, 2017. He was admitted to hospice \\nat the GIP level of care following an emergency room visit for a severe stroke and \\nsignificant neurologic symptoms. Dr. Leedy agreed with the decision to initiate GIP \\nservices because this patient\\'s unstable medical condition (including worsening \\ntachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, pain, lung congestion, and agitation) and risk of \\nrecurrent stroke and seizure due to the severity of his brain damage required around\\xad\\nthe-clock nursing monitoring and frequent administration of several intravenous \\nmedications.

Dr. Leedy confirms this in his Physician \\nStatement. Although he believes the records reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor \\nadequately supported the patients\\' eligibility and level of care, the OIG should have sought and \\nreviewed the patients\\' other records ifthere was any doubt concerning their eligibility or level of \\ncare.

Patient improvement or stabilization does not disqualify a person from the \\nhospice benefit. \\nCMS has long recognized that apparent improvement in an individual\\' s symptoms may \\nnot mean that the individual\\'s prognosis has improved.27 Hospices treat the whole person using \\na multidisciplinary approach, which often results in an improvement or stabilization of \\nsymptoms. CMS has thus acknowledged that it can be difficult to distinguish a sustainable \\nstabilization in a patient\\'s condition from the impression of stabilization that could not be \\nmaintained by the patient if discharged from hospice. This point was reaffirmed inAseraCare, \\ndiscussed infra, where the court acknowledged that, because predicting life expectanc y is not an \\nexact science, the Medicare framework recognizes that \"patients with an initial prognosis of \\nterminality can improve over time\" without losing their right to coverage. 28 \\nHere, however, the Medical Review Contractor improperly denied claims based on \\npatients\\' purported improvement or stabilization.29 For example, the Contractor denied patients \\nwhose weight remained stable or had improved , failing to recognize that some of the weight gain \\nexperienced by these patients had negative prognostic implications. 30 As another example, the \\nContractor denied the eligibility of a 97-year-old patient with untreated stomach cancer because \\nher pain was \"well managed\" by the hospice.31 However, the fact that the hospice was providing \\nthe patient with large doses of opioid analgesics to keep her escalating pain caused by a \\nprogressive stomach neoplasm in check does not mean her prognosis had improved. The \\nContractor also denied the eligibility of a 90-year-old patient who weighed only 100 pounds \\nbecause she was given Marino!, an appetite stimulate , and she began to eat 100% of her meals, \\ndespite the fact that this patient\\'s primary diagnosis was cerebral atherosclerosis , the LCD for \\nwhich does not require any weight loss or poor appetite.32 Even if these factors were \\nappropriately interpreted by the Contractor to be signs of improvement of the patients\\' prognoses \\n(which the hospice denies), it remains improper to discharge a patient until the hospice has \\nsufficient evidence that the stabilization or improvement can be maintained. If the hospice has \\nsufficient evidence to make that determination, it appropriat ely discharges patients with an \\nextended prognosis, as evidenced by the records reviewed by the Contractor.33 \\n27 70 Fed.

Denials relying on the benefit of hindsight must be overturned . \\nIt is clear that the Medical Review Contractor improperly made clinical eligibility \\ndeterminations using the benefit of hindsight, rather than evaluating the records from the \\nperspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. The applicable regulation and \\nMedicare Benefit Policy Manual make clear that the certification of a patient\\'s eligibility for \\nhospice must be based on the patient\\'s medical records or examination of the patient at the time \\nof the certification. 34 Several court cases have overturned denials related to eligibility for certain \\nMedicare benefits that \"impermissibly relied on the benefit of hindsight, which of course is \\nalways 20-20.\"35 For example, when Medicare contractors denied skilled nursing care because \\nthe records showed the patient was stable throughout the certification period, courts overturned \\nthe denials because \"[t]he services must ... be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the \\npatient when the services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected to be \\nappropriat e treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period. \"36 Further, \\ncourts have noted that Medicare beneficiaries shouldn\\'t have to risk deterioration to their health \\nin order to validate the care they\\'re receiving.37 These same principles equally apply to hospice \\nand are consistent with the CMS guidance .38 \\nFor many of the patients denied on the basis that they were not eligible, the Medical \\nReview Contractor appears to have relied on the fact that certain symptoms were not documented \\nfor these patients during the month under review. For every patient denied based on eligibility, \\nregardles s of diagnosis, the Contractor cited that the patients did not have documentation of any \\nstage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections , or sepsis, none of \\nwhich are required by any applicable LCD. Some patients actually experienced these signs or \\nsymptoms , but the Contractor did not count them because the patient responded to treatment. \\nFor example, one patient was hospitalized twice between January 2018 and April 2018 for \\npneumonia, but the Contractor denied his eligibility for the month of June 2018 because he did \\nnot have any documented aspiration pneumonia.39 For other patients, recurrent urinary tract \\ninfections did not count as \"frequent infections\" to support the patients\\' eligibility because, \\naccording to the Contractor, the infections responded to antibiotics.40 \\n34 See 42 C.F.R. § 418.22(b)(3)(iii); see also, CMS, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, CMS Pub.

Moreover , even the Medical Review Contractor could only know with the \\nimproper use of hindsight that, for example, a patient ultimatel y would not experience these \\nsigns and symptoms during the month at issue or the patients\\' symptoms would resolve. Yet, the \\nMedical Review Contractor denied the entire claim rather than define when exactly within that \\nmonth the failure to experience a specific sign or symptom should result in a change to the \\npatient\\'s prognosis.41 Furthermore , by focusing on these specific symptom s, the Contractor is \\nnot only conducting a hindsight evaluation of the records but is also ignoring other important \\nsigns and symptom s relevant to determining a patient\\'s terminal prognosis, which are described \\nfurther below and in the Patient Response Summaries. \\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that the Contractor improperly applied a retrospective \\nanalysis to the question of each beneficiary\\'s eligibility, in direct contravention of CMS guidance \\nand case law. Therefore, the denials must be reconsidered and redetermined without the \\nimproper use of hindsight . \\nd. Clinical benchmark s are not required to demonstrate tenninalit y. \\nLaw and guidance has made clear that in enacting the statutory and regulatory framework \\ngoverning hospice, Congress and CMS \"were careful to place the physician\\'s clinical judgment \\nat the center of the inquiry,\" and specifically chose not to impose \"a more rigid set of criteria for \\neligibility determinations that would have minimized the role of clinical judgment.\"42 Indeed, \\nthe AseraCare court explained, \"CMS has considered and expressly declined to impose defined \\ncriteria that would govern the physician \\'s exercise ofjudgment. \"43 Instead, the determin ation of \\nhospice eligibility under Medicare is \"centered on the subjective \\'clinical judgment\\' of a \\nphysician as to a patient\\'s life expectancy. ,.i4 Further, in 2008, CMS proposed a rule that would \\nidentify \"criteria\" that must be considered in certifying patients as terminall y ill,45 but \\nsubsequently removed the word \"criteria,\" however, \"in order to remove any implication that \\nthere are specific CMS clinical benchmarks in this rule that must be met in order to certify \\nterminal illness.\\'.i6 Accordingly, it is improper to rely on specific clinical criteria to deny \\neligibility. \\n41 Additionally, this is yet another instance in which the hospice is being punished for providing good care that \\nprevented patients from having ulcers or infections. \\n42 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1301. \\n43 Id \\n44 Id at 1291. \\n45 See Vista Hospice Care, 2016 WL 3449833, at *3. \\n46 See id (quoting 73 Fed.

For all of the patients denied on the basis of eligibility, the Contractor \\ncited the purported lack of stage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent \\ninfections , or sepsis, regardless of the patient\\'s primary diagnosis, as if all hospice patients \\nundoubtedly show such symptoms and the lack of such symptoms is proof the person is not \\neligible.

The Medical Review Contractor Failed to Apply the Law Consistent with the \\nRecent AseraCare Decision. \\nThe medical review determinations referenced in the Draft Report are inconsistent with \\nthe central holdings of AseraCare,52 a landmark decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \\nEleventh Circuit, which identified the governing standards for evaluating hospice eligibility \\ndeterminations. HPBC is located within the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit, andAseraCare \\nis the governing law for HPBC and for the federal government in that jurisdiction. As noted \\nearlier, althoughAseraCare arose under the False Claims Act, the standards set out in the \\ndecision applies to all applications of the Medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations.53 \\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of this legal framewor~ the AseraCare court \\nexpounded upon three standards that govern any audit of hospice services, including the present \\none: ( 1) a \"clinical standard,\" which holds that two physicians using their clinical judgment \\nabout a patient\\'s terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong; (2) a \"documentation \\nstandard,\" which requires only that the medical record support the physician \\'s clinical \\ndetermination as to hospice eligibility, rather than prove the determination as a \"matter of \\nmedical fact\"; and (3) a \"competency standard,\" which permits a later reversal of certifying \\nphysicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations only if a competent reviewer (i.e., a qualified \\nphysician ) finds that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have \\nconcluded that the patient was hospice eligible. Here, the Medical Review Contractor\\'s analysis \\nfalls short of all three of these standards. \\na. The Clinical Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Improperly \\nBased Its Determinations on a Reasonable Disagreement with the Hospice \\nPhysicians. \\nIn its decision, the AseraCare court made clear that \"the clinical judgment of the patient\\'s \\nattending physician (or the provider\\'s medical director, as the case may be) lies at the center of \\nthe eligibility inquiry. \"54 The court further recognized: \\nCMS\\'s rulemaking commentary signals that well-founded clinical \\njudgments should be granted deference [and] .... the law is designed \\nto give physicians meaningful latitude to make informed judgments \\nwithout fear that those judgments will be second-guessed after the \\nfact by laymen in a liability proceeding. 55 \\n52 938 F.3d 1278 (I Ith Cir. 2019). \\n\" See supra note 3. \\n54 Id at 1293. \\n55 Id at 1295. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

CMS has acknowledged that \"[i]t is the physician\\'s responsibi lity \\nto assess the patient\\'s medical condition and determine if the patient can be certified as \\nterminall y ill.\"57 The recognition of the hospice physician\\'s central role, both by CMS and the \\ncourt in AseraCare, is consistent with other cases requiring \"extra weight\" or deference be given \\nto a treating physician \\'s contemporaneous informed opinion unless there is a reasoned basis for \\ndeclining to do so. 58 CMS has also long recognized that a terminal prognosis is far from a \\n\"guarantee\" of death within six months, and some patients have the \"good fortune to live longer \\nthan predicted by a well-intentioned physician.\"59 \"The fact that a beneficiary lives longer than \\nexpected in itself is not cause to terminate benefits.\"60 Because prognostication is not an exact \\nscience, hospice physicians do not need to prognosticate with 100% certainty to establish a \\npatient\\'s eligibility for hospice. Rather, CMS has stated that eligibility for hospice exists for \\npatients whose clinical status is \"more likely than not to result in a life expectancy of six months \\nor less. \"61 Congress confirmed this approach to hospice eligibility when it eliminated the 210-\\nday limit on the Medicare hospice benefit. 62 \\nTheAseraCare court also recognized that \"predicting life expectancy is not an exact \\nscience,\" and no \"certitude can be expected of physicians in the practice of treating end-of-life \\nillness. ,\\'63 As a result, the court concluded that there are vagaries in prognostica tion that can lead \\nto divergent, yet equally valid and supported , predictions of life expectanc y. The court did not \\nconsider it appropriate or a valid application of the Medicare hospice benefit to allow a mere \\ndifference of opinion between clinicians to result in an adverse consequence for the hospice.

Under \\nAseraCare, that is not enough to refute the hospice physicians \\' equally reasonable conclusion \\n(reached based on the physicians\\' clinical judgment at the time they were treating the patients) \\nthat the patients had a terminal prognosis. \\nThe OIG cannot base its Draft Report only on a reasonable disagreement between the \\nphysicians who certified and recertified these patients (i.e., the physicians who actually cared for \\nthe patients and appropriately applied their clinical judgment to make eligibility determinations ) \\nand its Medical Review Contractor who reviewed those certification s years later. The law \\nrequires more, yet the Medical Review Summaries fail to provide it. \\nb. The Documentation Standard: The Medical Review Contractor \\nImproperly Demanded that the Medical Record Prove, Rather than \\nSupport, a Patient\\'s Terminal Prognosis. \\nThe AseraCare court recognized that, under the plain language of the Medicare Statute \\nand implementing regulations , \"a patient is eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit if the \\nappropriate physician makes a clinical judgment that the patient is terminally ill in light of the \\npatient\\'s complete medical picture, as evidenced by the patient\\'s medical records.\"65 However , \\nthe court held that the medical record supportin g the physician \\'s clinical judgment is not required \\nto prove the validity of that clinical judgment , explaining: \\n65 Id at 1293 (emphasis added). \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Nor does this \\nframework state or imply that the patient\\'s medical records must \\nunequivocally demonstrate to an unaffiliated physician, reviewing \\nthe records after the fact, that the patient was likely to die within six \\nmonths of the time the certifying physician\\'s clinical judgment was \\nmade.66 \\nIn other words, AseraCare held that the physician \\'s clinical judgment is the \"controlling \\ncondition of reimbursement\" and supporting documentation need not, \"standing alone, prove the \\nvalidity of the physician\\'s initial clinicaljudgm ent.\"67 If such were the case, the physician \\ncertification requirement would be superl1uous. \\nThe Medical Review Contractor\\'s analyses and resulting determination s do not reflect the \\ncurrent standard for evaluating the hospice medical record, as set forth in AseraCare. The \\nContractor \\'s findings that the document ation did not support patient eligibility or level of care is \\nflawed because the Contractor cited only cherry-picked factors tending to support its denials \\nwhile completel y disregarding other highly probative facts that supported the patients\\' \\ncertifications and recertifications and level of care detenninations. Identification of a few \\ndiscrete facts that could only arguably support their conclusions that the patients were not \\nterminally ill or did not require the level of care received-a point that HPBC emphatically \\nrejects-does not satisfy the standard for evaluating documentation under AseraCare. At best, \\nthe Contractor\\'s determinations accomplish nothing more than stating that the medical record \\nsupports two divergent opinions regarding terminality, which fails to demonstrate that the \\npatients were certified in error. By ignoring other facts in the record supportin g the certifications \\nand recertifications, the OIG Medical Review Contractor applied a much more exacting standard \\nin the course of its review. Accordingly, the Medical Review Summari es should be rejected. \\nc. The Competency Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Is Not \\nQualified to Evaluate the Exercise of Clinical Judgment by the \\nExperienced Hospice Physician s. \\nFollowingAseraCar e, it is clear that the post hoc scrutiny of treating physicians\\' \\ncontemporaneous \"properly formed and sincerely held clinicaljudgment[s]\" is not enough to \\nundermine the physicians \\' eligibility determinations . 68 Rather, a reversal of certifying \\nphysicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations is appropriate only if, based on a reasonable \\ninterpretation of the relevant medical records, one can conclude that no reasonable physician, \\napplying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the \\n66 Id at 1293-94. \\n67 Id at 1291, 1294. \\n68 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1297. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

A necessary corollary of this holding (and the first two standards \\ndescribed above) is a requirement that the individuals conducting this post hoc review be \\nqualified to provide \"a reasonable interpretation \" of the medical record to determine what a \\n\"reasonable physician\" would or would not conclude. In other words, under the central \\nprinciples outlined inAseraCare , only a trained hospice physician is competent to evaluate the \\nexercise of clinical judgment by the experienced hospice physicians. \\nHere, HPBC\\'s skilled and experienced physician s certified the patients reviewed by the \\nMedical Review Contractor as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients\\' circumstances \\nand the physicians \\' best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the \\nnormal course of the patients\\' terminal illnesses. HPBC\\'s physicians\\' clinical judgment was \\nfurther reviewed and affirmed by Dr. Leedy, who is Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative \\nCare Medicine and a Fellow of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.69 \\nThe OIG, on the other hand, has not identified either the Medical Review Contractor or the \\nphysicians who reviewed, and ultimately disagreed with, the certifying physician s\\' \\ncontemporaneous eligibility and level of care detern1ination s, much less identified their \\ncredentials and qualifications . 70 \\nIt is concerning that the OIG has refused to provide more detail concerning the physician \\nreviewers\\' qualifications so that its audit process is as transparent and credible as possible. Even \\nwhen HPBC requested this infonnation , the OIG responded that it does not obtain the physician \\nreviewer resumes but relies, instead, on the generic representation s made by the Medical Review \\nContractor during the competitiv e bidding process regarding the qualifications of the reviewers. \\nWe have included with this letter copies of our independent expert physician\\'s curriculum \\nvitae.71 It is difficult to fathom how the OIG can find a completely anonymous reviewer more \\ncredible than the certifying physicians and Dr. Leedy, who are highly experienced in hospice and \\nwell-credentialed. \\nDr. Leedy\\'s Physician Statement makes clear that the qualifications of the Medical \\nReview Contractor\\'s anonymous reviewers are in serious doubt. Numerous other providers have \\nrecently raised concern about the qualifications of the Medical Review Contractor \\'s medical \\nreviewer.72 The OIG\\'s failure to verify the qualifications of the Contractor\\'s reviewers after \\n69 See Exhibit 2. \\n70 The end of each Medical Review Summary includes the following generic statement: \\nThe physician who reviewed this case is licensed to practice medicine, is knowledgeable in the \\ntreatment of the emollee\\'s medical condition, and is familiar with guidelines and protocols in the \\narea of treatment under review.

The Extrapolation of the Alleged Overpaym ent Here is Invalid and Inappropriate . \\nWe ask that the OIG reconsider its use of sampling and extrapolation to arrive at the \\nestimated overpayment here for at least two reasons. First, extrapolation is not appropriate for \\ncalculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of \\nprognostication. Second, the OIG\\'s statistical methodology was fundamentally flawed, and the \\nextrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid. \\n1. Extrapolation is Not Appropriate for Calculating Hospice Overpayments \\nGiven The Individuali zed Nature of Prognostication. \\nThe OIG\\'s attempted calculation of an overpayment amount through statistical sampling \\nand extrapolation fails to take into consideration the unique nature of hospice, including each \\nhospice patient\\'s relevant clinical profile, and the subjective and inexact nature of each hospice \\nphysician\\'s prognostication. Such an attempted calculation premised on clinical eligibility for \\nhospice cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimated overpayment. \\nThe definitions of eligibility for hospice care are not operationally defined because of the \\nneed for subjective clinical judgments by individual physicians in the hospice context. \\nConsequently, overpayments associated with audited services relative to hospice patients\\' life \\nexpectancy cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy to allow for extrapolation of an \\nauditor\\'s findings across a population with sufficient confidence.76 \\nThis unique nature of hospice prognostication is supported by several cases, which have \\nnoted that extrapolation is inappropriate in the hospice contell.1-. In U.S. ex rel. Michaels v. Agape \\nSenior Cmty., Inc., the court held that statistical sampling and extrapolation could not be used to \\nestablish liability since \"each and every claim at issue\" was \"fact-dependent and wholly \\nunrelated to each and every other claim.\"77 The Agape court stated that extrapolation is \\nunsuitable for circumstances where determination of medical necessity or terminal prognosis \\n7\\' Caring Hearts Personal Home Services, Inc. v.

In this matter, the Act \\nshould not be interpreted to permit use of extrapolation in circumstances where Congress clearly \\ndid not intend it.89 Such interpretation would also produce absurd results. If a particular \\napplication of a statute produces an absurd result, the courts should and will interpret the statute \\nto reflect what Congress would have intended had it confronted the absurdity .90 \\nThe payment model Congress designed for hospices includes many features to ensure that \\nhospices take responsibility for virtually all end of life care for their patients, while providing \\noverall cost-savings to the Medicare trust.91 This responsibility and burden that Congress has \\nimposed on hospices, and that hospices freely accept, is incompatible with the additional, \\ndraconian consequences that would result if extrapolation were pe1mitted.

The OIG\\'s Sampling and Extrapolation ofHPBC\\'s Claims are Statistically \\nInvalid. \\nHPBC engaged Dr. R. Mitchell Cox to evaluate the OIG\\'s statistical sampling and \\nextrapolation methodology. Dr. Cox has decades of experience providing independ ent analysis \\nof statistical sampling and extrapolation in the healthcare context.95 He has served as a statistical \\nexpert in numerous appeals of overpayment determinations before Administrative Law Judges \\nand in federal courts. Attached as Exhibit 40 is Dr. Cox\\'s Expert Report, which identifies and \\nexplains multiple procedural and statistical concerns with respect to the OIG\\'s statistical \\nsampling methodology and extrapolation .96 Each of the flaws detailed in Dr. Cox\\'s report \\ndemonstrates that the extrapolat ion is statistically invalid. \\nFirst, the OIG failed to prove that it used a statistically valid random sample because it \\ndid not provide documentation sufficient to re-create the sampling frame or the sample. \\nSpecifically, it did not provide documentation showing that the order of claims in the frame was \\nfixed and documented prior to sample selection. The order of claims in a sampling frame should \\nbe fixed and documented before the sample is selected to show that the sample was not \\nimproperly drawn or manipulated. The failure to fix and document the order of the claims in the \\nsampling frame prior to sample selection means the sample does not conform to basic statistical \\nrequirements and is not statistically valid. Here, the OIG\\'s statistician did not provide \\ndocumentation to support the proper ordering of the sampling frame. Specifically, the OIG failed \\nto provide the sort order of the sampling frame and the random number seed that was used to \\ninitialize the random number generator. The former is needed to re-create the sampling frame, \\nand the latter is needed to re-create the sample. Accordingly , it cannot be determined that the \\nOIG drew a statistically valid random sample in this audit and extrapolation . \\nSecond, the precision and the confidence level are the two most important parameters for \\na statistical estimate. To have a standard precision of 10% and a two-sided 90% confidence \\ninterval, which the OIG claims it used, a sample size of 530 claims (instead of the 100 claims \\nthat the OIG reviewed) would have been required. According to the OIG\\'s own guideline s, the \\nsample here is only 19% of the size that it should have been, and the precision is 23.38% (more \\nthan double the standard precision of 10%). Even if an overpaym ent exists, which HPBC denies, \\nthis inadequate sample size may mean that HPBC is being asked to significantly over-reimburs e \\n93 Vista Hospice Care at *13 (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

The \\nOIG\\'s sample size determination procedure fails because its sampling units -claims -are not \\nstatistically independent where there are multiple claims belonging to the same beneficiary or \\nepisode of care. In this case, a sizable fraction of the beneficiarie s and episodes of care in the \\nOIG\\'s sampling frame had multiple claims, so a sizable fraction of the claims in the OIG\\'s \\nsampling frame cannot be assumed to be statistically independent. The OIG\\'s sampling \\nprocedure ignored this fact, resulting in a sample too small to achieve an acceptable value of the \\nprecision and possibly resulting in the OIG asking Trustbridge to reimburse much more than it \\notherwise would. \\nFourth, the OIG violated statistical principles when it improperly removed potential \\nunderpayments from its sampling frame and thereby introduced a bias towards overpayments \\ninto its sampling frame and into its sample. In the OIG\\'s sampling plan, the OIG states that zero\\xad\\npaid claims (potential underpayments) were excluded from the universe. Since the zero-paid \\nclaims were excluded from the universe, they were not available to be selected for the sample \\nhere and thus did not factor into the extrapolated overpayment. Statistical principles require the \\ninclusion of zero-paid claims in the universe. This exclusion of unpaid and potentially underpaid \\nclaims puts HPBC at an extreme disadvantage because it likely resulted in an improperly inflated \\nextrapolated amount that the OIG has deemed an overpayment. There is absolutely no legal, \\nadministrative, or statistical justification for the OIG to have removed the zero-paid claims from \\nthe universe. \\nFinally, the extrapolation is unfounded because the payment error rate derived from the \\nOIG\\'s review is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolation. The OIG stated in its draft \\nreport that \"CMS, acting through a MAC [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or other \\ncontractor, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments \\nconsistent with its policies and procedures.\" The policies and procedures followed by CMS \\ninclude the MPIM. While HPBC realizes that the OIG is not a Medicare contractor and, \\naccordingly, maintains that it is not bound by the MPIM, the MPIM is a reliable recitation of \\nestablished statistical principles . Of course, any recoupment amount extrapolated from a sample, \\nincluding the current one, must ultimately comply with the requirements of the MPIM to be \\nenforceable . \\nUnder section 1893([)(3) of the Act, extrapolation is only permitted if the Secretary of the \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services determines there is a \"sustained or high level of \\npayment error.\" Under the MPIM, § 8.4.1.4, a finding of\"sustained or high level of payment \\nerror\" cannot be based upon a post-payment review error rate unless the error rate is greater than \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

From the audit of HPBC by the OIG, the financial error rate (the total dollar amount \\nallegedly paid in error divided by the total dollar amount paid for all claims in the sample) is \\n0.37 or 37%. Therefore, HPBC\\'s overpayment did not meet the minimum high error rate \\nstandard of 50% set out in the MPIM, and the MAC tasked with determinin g whether an \\noverpayment exists will not be permitted to extrapolate. \\nAny one of Conclusions 1 through 5 stands either on its own or in combination with the \\nother conclusions to invalidate the OIG\\'s overpayment estimate. In Dr. Cox\\'s professional \\nopinion, the OIG\\'s Sampling Plan is not an adequate foundation for statistical sampling for \\noverpayment estimation . Therefore, the OIG\\'s estimate for the population is not supportab le \\nunder the OIG regulations , Medicare guidelines, and generally accepted statistical principles. \\n3. The SIA-Related Ovemayments Identified by the OIG Cannot Form Basis of \\nExtrapolation \\nBecause the total service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") overpayment amount in the sampling \\nframe can be quantified through a case-by-case review, the SIA overpayments identified by the \\nOIG with respect to three sampled claims cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated SIA \\noverpayment amount. \\nThe OIG detenuined that the HPBC received $335.57 in improper SIA payments for \\nsampled claims 63, 70, and 100. Upon investigation, the HPBC found that the root cause of the \\nSIA overpayments was both a Palmetto system error, as well as a technological i ssue within its \\nelectronic medical record (\"EMR\") system that inadvertently over-reporte d certain SIA-eligible \\nunits on the claims. HPBC is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and \\nquantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA overpayment amount for each claim. \\nOnce it has completed this quantification, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Medicare the total \\nSIA overpayment amount for all claims impacted by these issues. \\nBecause the total SIA overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified \\nmanually and repaid accurately without the use of statistical sampling, the OIG is not permitted to \\nuse sampling to extrapolate a total estimated SIA overpayment amount. Statistical sampling may \\nbe used to estimate overpayme nts \"when claims are voluminous ... and when a case-by-case review \\nis not administratively feasible. \"97 The justification for and constitutional soundness of statistical \\nsampling rests on it being \"the only feasible method available\" for the government to determine \\noverpayments in some cases.98 Courts have refused, however, to allow statistical sampling when \\n97 HCFA Ruling No. 86-1 (emphasis added); see also ChavesCnty. Home Health Serv., Inc. v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 914, \\n919 (D.C.

Accordingly, the OIG should remove from its $42,336,162 estimated overpayme nt \\nthe amount that was based on a legally impermissible extrapolation of the $335.57 in SIA \\noverpayments identified in the three sampled claims. \\nD. Liability for the OIG\\'s Overpayment Determination Must Be Waived Under Sections \\n1879 and 1870 of the Act. \\nSections 1879 and 1870 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayment \\namounts even if the patients at issue were not terminally ill. The Hospice met the requirements \\nfor those waivers. Under the Caring Hearts case, the federal Court of Appeals for the Tenth \\nCircuit described Section 1879 as follows: \\nIn seeming recognition of the complexity of the Medicare maze, \\nCongress [in Section 1879] indicated that providers who didn\\'t know \\nand couldn\\'t have reasonably been expected to know that their \\nservices weren\\'t permissible when rendered generally don\\'t have to \\nrepay the amounts they received from CMS. A sort of good faith \\naffirmative defense, if you wilI.100 \\nUnder Caring Hearts, CMS must forgive \"mistakes\" of the provider if the provider\\'s \\npurported mistakes were reasonable and supported the propriety of the services provided. \\nMoreover, section 1879(g)(2) expressly includes mistakes related to determination that a hospice \\npatient is not terminall y ill. Congress specifically added Section 1879(g)(2) to expand this \\nwaiver to determinations that a patient is not terminally ill as a means of providing some \\nfinancial protection for hospices, since hospices must assume a significant financial burden for \\ntheir patients based on an inherently imprecise clinical judgment regarding whether a patient\\'s \\nterminal illness will follow the nonnal course.101 \\nSimilarly, waiver of liability is required under Section 1870 if a provider is \"without \\nfault\" because it \"had a reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was c01Tect .... \"102 To be \\n99 See, e.g. US. ex rel.

The Medical Review \\nContractor has failed to show that HPBC should have known that its physicians\\' certification \\nwould be deemed in error years later or that the physicians\\' certifications or level of care \\ndeterminations were unreasonable. When viewed in light of the correct standard for evaluating \\nhospice eligibility, HPBC did not and could not reasonably have known or been expected to \\nknow that any of the patients under review would be determined years later to not be terminally \\nill. After all, \"physicians applying their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s projected life \\nexpectancy could disagree, and neither physician [] be wrong. \"104 For these reasons, HPBC \\nrequests that the OIG address and evaluate waiver under Sections 1879 or 1870 before issuing its \\nfinal report. \\nE.

Response to Recommendations in the OIG\\'s Draft Report \\nThere are three recommendations in the Draft Report: (1) refund the portion of the \\nalleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable \\ndiligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; \\nand (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure hospice services comply with Medicare \\nrequirements. HPBC\\'s position with respect to these recommendations is set forth below. \\nA. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of The Alleged Improper Payments \\nWithin the 4-year Claim Reopening Period. \\nHPBC has already voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims with an SIA \\noverpayment (Sample #63 and 100) and is in the process of identifying and voluntarily refunding \\nother SIA overpayments that were the result of a Palmetto system error and EMR system error, \\nincluding the SIA payment for Sample #70.108 HPBC does not concur with this recommendation \\nwith respect to all other claims denied by the Medical Review Contractor.109 HPBC and its \\nexpert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the OIG and have determined \\nthat HPBC did not receive an overpayment and that the Medical Review Contractor\\'s claim \\ndenials and the OIG\\'s statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law with respect to \\nthese other claims. The rationale for HPBC\\'s determinati ons is set fo1th in this letter and the \\nPatient Response Summaries prepared by its independent expert physician, Dr. Leedy. If any \\nattempt is made by HPBC\\'s MAC to recoup funds related to the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC intends to \\nexercise all appeal rights available to it. \\nB. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of Other Overpaymen ts in Accordance \\nwith 60-Day Repayment Rule. \\nHPBC acknowledges its obligations under the 60-Day Repayment Rule. As noted above, \\nHPBC has voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims and will be making further \\nvoluntary repayments associate d with SIA overpayments currently being investigated. However, \\nbesides claims involving SIA payments, HPBC has determined that no other repayments under \\nthis rule are warranted at this time. The Draft Report indicates that the OIG believes its report \\nconstitutes credible information of potential overpayments, and, therefore, HPBC must \"exercise \\nreasonabl e diligence to identify overpayments\" for a 6-year lookback period pursuant to the \\nrequirements of the 60-day rule in§ 1128J(d) of the Act and 42 C.F.R. § 401.305 applies. As \\n108 On April 8, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Palmetto for service intensity add-on payments received \\nfrom April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. This refund included a repayment of SIA payments for two individuals \\nincluded in the OIG sample (Samples 63 and 100). \\n109 This includes all 37 claims denied on the basis of eligibility or level of care. \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 \\nMedicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 55     BLACKWELL \\nMs. Brenda Tierney \\nJuly 12, 2022 \\nPage 34 \\nnoted above, HPBC and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the \\nOIG and have determined that it did not receive any other overpayments and that the OIG\\'s \\nclaim denials and statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law. Accordingly , HPBC \\nhas met the obligations of§ 1128J( d) of the Act and 42 C.F .R. § 401.305 as set out by CMS in \\n81 Fed. Reg. 7654 (Feb. 12, 2016). \\nC. Response to OIG Recommendation to Strengthen its Policies and Procedures. \\nHPBC does not concur with this recommendation. As already discussed, HPBC has \\nrobust policies and procedures and corporate compliance program, which are shown by a number \\nof CMS data sets to be effective. HPBC\\'s policies and procedures comply with and incorporate \\nthe Medicare requirements. While HPBC routinely and proactively takes steps to strengthen its \\npractices to ensure compliance with the everchanging Medicare requirements , it disagrees that \\nany particular flaws exist in its current policies and procedures that allowed ineligible patients to \\nbe certified for hospice or allowed provision of unnecessary GIP or CHC care. Moreover, the \\nDraft Report does not identify any particular flaws. To be sure, HPBC has confirmed through an \\nindependent expert physician that its claims were appropriate. As noted throughout, the Draft \\nReport is significantly flawed and is indicative of an overzealous, inexperienced Medical Review \\nContractor. \\nCONCLUSION \\nThank you once again for the opportunity to present these comments to the Draft Report. \\nWe appreciate the work that the OIG has put into this effort, and we respectfully request that the \\nOIG consider these comments in reviewing and revising the Draft Report. \\nBKN/EMS \\nEnclosures \\nHB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Sincerely, 2A \\nBryan K.

This statutory mission is carried out through a nationwide network of audits, investigations, and inspections conducted by the following operating components: Office of Audit Services The Office of Audit Services (OAS) provides auditing services for HHS, either by conducting audits with its own audit resources or by overseeing audit work done by others.  Audits examine the performance of HHS programs and/or its grantees and contractors in carrying out their respective responsibilities and are intended to provide independent assessments of HHS programs and operations.  These audit s help reduce waste, abuse, and mismanagement and promote economy and efficiency throughout HHS. Office of Evaluation and Inspections The Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI) conducts national evaluations to provide HHS, Congress, and the public with timely, useful, and reliable information on significant issues.  These evaluations focus on preventing fraud, waste, or abuse and promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of departmental programs.  To promote impact, OEI reports also present practical recommendations for improving program operations. Office of Investigations The Office of Investigations (OI) conducts criminal, civil, and administrative investigations of fraud and misconduct related to HHS programs, operations, and beneficiaries.  With investigators working in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, OI util izes its resources by actively coordinating with the Department of Justice and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities.  The investigative efforts of OI often lead to criminal convictions, administrative sanctions, and/or civil monetary penalties. Office of Counsel to the Inspector General The Office of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) provides general legal services to OIG, rendering advice and opinions on HHS programs and operations and providing all lega l support for OIG’s internal operations.  OCIG represents OIG in all civil and administrative fraud and abuse cases involving HHS programs, including False Claims Act, program exclusion, and civil monetary penalty cases.  In connection with these cases, OC IG also negotiates and monitors corporate integrity agreements.  OCIG renders advisory opinions, issues compliance program guidance, publishes fraud alerts, and provides other guidance to the health care industry concerning the anti- kickback statute and ot her OIG enforcement authorities.

Previous OIG reviews found that Medicare inappropriately paid for hospice services that did not meet certain Medicare requirements. Our objective was to determine whether hospice services provided by Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. (HPBC ), complied with Medicare requirements. How OIG Did This Audit Our audit covered 37,121 claims for which HPBC (located in Palm Beach, Florida) received Medicare reimbursement of $149 million for hospice services provided from April 2017 through March 2019. We reviewed a random sample of 100 claims . We evaluated compliance with selected Medicare billing requirements and submitted these sampled claims and the associated medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, medical necessity, and coding requirements . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit : Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. What OIG Found HPBC received Medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements . Of the 100 hospice claims in our sample , 60 claims complied with Medicare requirement. However, the remaining 40 did not comply with the requirements. Specifically , the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal illness prognosis (30 claims) , the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed (9 claims) , and services were not supported in the medical record (3 claims) . The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. Improper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies and procedures were not effective in ensuring the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, the appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC received at least $ 42.3 million in improper Medicare reimbursement for hospice services . What OIG Recommends and HPBC Comments We recommend that HPBC: (1) refund to the Federal Government the portion of the estimated $42.3 million in Medicare overpayments that are within the 4 -year reopening period; (2) based upon the results o f this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return overpayments, in accordance with the 60 -day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. In written comments on our draft report, HPBC disagreed with our findings and recommendations.  Specifically, HPBC disagreed with all but 3 of the 40 sample claims questioned in our report. HBPC asserted that our conclusions were inaccurate or divergent from the clinical facts present in the medical records . HPBC also engaged a statistical expert who challenged the validity of our statistical sampling methodology and the resulting extrapolation. After reviewing HPBC’s comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We also reviewed HPBC’s statistical expert’s comments and maintain that our statistical methodology and extrapolation are statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC.

Previous Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits and eval uations found that Medicare inappropriately paid for hospice services that did not meet certain Medicare requirements.1 OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine whether hospice services provided by Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. (HPBC ), complied with Medicare requirements. BACKGROUND The Medicare Program Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) established the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage to people aged 65 and over, people with disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare program. Medicare Part A, also known as hospital insurance, provides for the coverage of various types of services, including hospice services.2 CMS contracts with Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to pro cess and pay Medicare hospice claims in four home health and hospice jurisdictions . The Medicare Hospice Benefit To be eligible to elect Medicare hospice care, a beneficiary must be entitled to Medicare Part A and certified by a physician as being terminally ill (i.e., as having a medical prognosis with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course) .3 Hospice care is palliative (supportive), rather than curative, and includes, among other thing s, nursing care, medical social services, hospice aide services, medical supplies, and physician services. The Medicare hospice benefit has four levels of care: (1) routine home care, (2) general inpatient (GIP) care , 1 See Appendix B for a list of related OIG reports on Medicare hospice services. 2 The Act §§ 1812(a)(4) and (5). 3 The Act §§ 1814(a)(7)(A) and 1861(dd)(3)(A) and 42 CFR §§ 418.20 and 418.3. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 1                                                                                                                                                      (3)inpatient respite care, and (4) continuous home care (CHC) .  Medicare provides an all-inclusive daily payment based upon the level of care .4 Beneficiaries eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit may elect hospice care by filing a signed election statement with a hospice.5 Upon election, the hospice assumes the responsibility for medical care of the beneficiary’s terminal illness , and the beneficiary waives all rights to Medicare payment for services that are related to the treatment of the terminal condition or related conditions for the duration of the election, except for services provided by the designated hospice directly or under arra ngements or services of the beneficiary’s attending physician if the physician is not employed by or receiving compensation from the designated hospice .6 The hospice must submit a notice of election (NOE) to its MAC within 5 calendar days after the effective date of election.  If the hospice does not submit the NOE to its MAC within the required timeframe, Medicare will not cover and pay for days of hospice care from the effective date of election to the date that the NOE was submitted to the MAC .7 Beneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods.8 At the start of the initial 90 -day benefit period of care, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s terminal illness from the hospice medical director or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group9 and the beneficiary’s attending physician, if any.

The physician or nurse practitioner conducting the face -to-face encounter must gather and document clinical finding s to support a life expectancy of 6 months or less.13 Effective for dates of service beginning January 1, 2016, hospices can claim a service intensity add-on (SIA) payment for direct patient care provided by a registered nurse and/or a social worker to a beneficiary receiving routine home care during the last 7 days of life.14 Hospice providers must establish and maintain a clinical record for each hospice patient .15 The record must include all services, whether furnished directly or under arrangements made by the hospice . Clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis of a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course must be filed in the medical record with the written certification of ter minal illness .16 Medicare Requirements To Identify and Return Overpayments OIG believes that this audit report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments. Upon receiving credible information of potential overpayments, providers must exercise reasonable diligence to identify overpayments (i.e., determine receipt of and quantify any overpayments) during a 6 -year lookback period. Providers must report and return any identified overpayments by the later of (1) 60 days after identifying those overpayments or (2) the date that any corresponding cost report is due (if applicable).  This is known as the 60-day rule.17 The 6 -year lookback period is not limited by OIG’s audit period or restrictions on the Government’s ability to reopen claims or co st reports.

HPBC is a not -for-profit hospice provider located in West Palm Beach, Florida.19 From April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019 (audit period) , HPBC provided hospice services to 12,762 beneficiaries and received Medicare reimbursement of almost $150 million .20 Palmetto GBA , LLC (Palmetto) serves as the MAC for HPBC . HOW WE CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT Our audit covered 37, 121 claims totaling $149,850,136.21 We reviewed a random sample of 100 of these claims , totaling $ 402,424, to determine whether hospice services complied with Medicare requirements . Specifically, we evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements and submitted the se sampled claims and the associated medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, medical necessity, and coding requirements . We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditi ng standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our find ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our find ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix A contains the de scribes our audit scope and methodology, Appendix C describes our statistical sampling methodology, and Appendix D contains our sample results and estimates . 18 42 CFR §§ 401.305(d), 405.980(c)(4), and 413.24(f); CMS’ Provider Reimbursement Manual, Pub. 15 -1-Part 1 , § 2931.2; and 81 Fed. Reg. at 7670. 19 HPBC is one of three hospices operated by Trustbridge , a nonprofit organization that offers hospice and palliative services throughout Florida’s Broward and Palm Beach counties. 20 Claims data for the period April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019, was the most current data available when we started our audit. 21 In developing this sampling frame, we included hospice claims for which a payment was made from the Medicare Trust Fund and claims that were not identified in the Recovery Audit Contractor data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 4                                                                                                                                                               FINDING S HPBC received Medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements. Of the 100 hospice claims in our sample, 6 0 claims complied with requirements, but 40 did not. Specifically: • For 30 claims, the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal prognosis. • For nine claims, the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed for Medicare reimbursement. • For three claims, the medical record did not support services claimed for SIA payment s.22 Improper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies and procedures were not effective in ensur ing the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, t he appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42.3 million in improper Medicare reimbursement for hospice services.23 As of the publication of this report, this unallowable amount includes claims outside the 4 -year reopening period .24 Notwithstanding, HPBC can request that a Medicare contractor reopen the initial determinations for those claims for the purpose of reporting and returning overpayments under the 60 -day rule without being limited by the 4 -year reopening period .25 TERMINAL PROGNOSIS NOT SUPPORTED To be eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit, a beneficiary must be c ertified as being terminally ill. Beneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods. At the start of the initial 90 -day benefit period of care, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s terminal illness from the hospice medical director or the phy sician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group and the individual’s attending physician, if any. For subsequent benefit periods, a written certification from the hospice medical director or the physician member of 22 The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. 23 Specifically, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42,336,162 in overpayments. To be conservative, we recommend recovery of overpayments at the lower limit of a two -sided 90- percent confidence interval.  Lower limits calculated in this manner are designed to be less than the actual overpayment total 95 percent of the time. 24 42 CFR § 405.980(b)(2) (permitting a contractor to reopen within 4 years for good cause) and 42 CFR § 405.980(c)(2) (permitting a party to request that a contractor reopen within 4 years for g ood cause). 25 42 CFR § 405.980(c)(4).

Clinical information and other documentation that supports the beneficiary’s terminal prognosis must accompany the physician’s certification and be filed in the medical record with the written certification of terminal illness.26 For 30 of the 100 sample claims, the clinical record provided by HPBC did not support the associated beneficiary’s terminal prognosis . Specifically, the in dependent medical review contractor determined that the records for these claims did not contain sufficient clinical information and other documentation to support the medical prognosis of a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness r an its normal course. LEVEL OF CARE NOT SUPPORTED Medicare reimbursement for hospice services is made at predetermined payment rates —based on the level of care provided —for each day that a beneficiary is under the hospice’s care.  The four levels are: (1) routine home , (2) GIP care, (3) inpatient respite care, and (4) CHC. 27 GIP care is provided in an inpatient facility for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that cannot be managed in other settings, such as the beneficiary’s home, and is intended to be short- term.28 Routine home care is the least expensive level of hospi ce care, followed by inpatient respite care, GIP care, and CHC which is the most expensive level of hospice care. For nine claims in o ur sample , the associated beneficiary’s clinical record did not support the need for the claimed level of care. Specifically, the associated beneficiaries’ hospice care needs could have been met if HPBC had provided services at the less expensive routine level of c are.29 SERVICES NOT SUPPORTED Effective for hospice services with dates of beginning January 1, 2016, hospices can claim an SIA payment for direct patient care provided by a registered nurse and/or a social worker to a beneficiary receiving routine home care during the last 7 days of life.30 The SIA payment is in 26 42 CFR §§ 418.22(b)(2) and 418.104(a). 27 Definitions and payment procedures for specific level -of-care categories are codified at 42 CFR § 418.302. For dates of service on or after January 1, 2016, there are two daily payment rates for routine home care – a higher rate for the first 60 days and a lower rate for days 61 and beyond.  80 Fed. Reg. 47142, 47172 (Aug. 6, 2015). 28 42 CFR §§ 418.302(b)(4) and 418.202(e). 29 For seven of the nine claims, we used the applicable payment rates and questioned the difference in payment amounts between the claimed level of care and routine levels of care.  For two other claims, we questioned the entire amount because the claims had more than one deficiency. For these claims, the terminal prognosis was not supported. 30 42 CFR § 418.302(b)(1).

A minimum of 15 minutes (1 unit) of nursing and/or social worker services must be provided to receive the SIA payment . 31 For three sample claims, HPBC received SIA payments for which it was not eligible . Specifically, HPBC was not eligible for SIA payments associated with 47 units that were not documented in the associated beneficiary’s medical file. RECOMMENDATION S We recommend that Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc.: • refund to the Federal Government the portion of the estimated $42,336,162 for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements and that are within the 4-year claims reopening period;32 • based upon the results of this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60 -day rule33 and identify any of those returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendat ion; and • strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements . HPBC COMMENTS AND OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL RESPONSE In written comments on our draft report, HPBC , through its attorney, disagreed with our recommendations and disagreed with most of our findings. Specifically, HPBC disagreed with 31 80 Fed. Reg. 47142, 47175 (Aug. 6, 2015). See also, CMS’s Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Pub. 100- 04, chapter 11, § 30.2.2. 32 OIG audit recommendations do not represent final determinations by Medicare.  CMS, acting through a MAC or other co ntracto r, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures.  Providers have the right to appeal those determinations and should familiarize themselves with the rules pertaining to when o verpaym ents must be returned or are subject to offset while an appeal is pending.  The Medicare Part A and Part B appeals process has five levels (42 CFR § 405.904(a)(2)), and if a provider exercises its right to an appeal, the provider does not need to return overpayments until after the second level of appeal.  Potential overpayments identified in OIG reports that are based on extrapolation may be re -estimated depending on CMS determinations and the outcome of appeals. 33 This recommendation does not apply to any overpayments that are both within our sampling frame (i.e., the population from which we selected our statistical sample) and refunded based upon the extrapolated overpayment amount.  Those overpayments are already covered in the previous recommendation. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 7                                                                                                                                                                                   all but 3 of the 40 sample claims questioned in our draft report.34 Although HPBC acknowledged its obligations under the 60 -day rule, it reviewed our audit findings and did not agree that a dditional refunds pursuant to the rule were warranted at this time .  HPBC also did not agree with our recommendation to strengthen its policies and procedures because it believes it has robust policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements.  However, HPBC did state that it will continue to routinely review and update its policies to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws. HPBC asserted that OIG’s audit is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects and, as a result, OIG’s overpayment determinations are invalid . Specifically, HPBC believed that the clinical documentation it submitted for the sample claims met Medicare requirements and that OIG’s medical review contractor’s denials were inconsistent with hospice regulations and guidance. HPBC contended that the medical review contr actor ignored patients’ overall medical condition, focused on irrelevant points, and “cherry -picked” information that resulted in misleading, incomplete, and inaccurate conclusions. HPBC further argued that statistical extrapolation was an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of hospice services because of the individualized nature of each patient’s clinical profile and the subjective and inexact nature of a physician’s level of care determinations (prognostication).  HPBC engaged a statistical expert, who evaluated OIG’s sampling and extrapolation methodologies, and claimed in a report that, even if extrapolation was appropriate, OIG’s sampling and extrapolation were not statistically valid. Lastly , HPBC stated that the SIA related overpayments found in our sample cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated overpayment amount. HPBC also contended that sections 1870 and 1879 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayments, even if the associated beneficiaries were not terminally ill, as long as the provider has a reasonable basis for assuming the claims it submitted were correct.  Accordingly, HPBC stated that the overpayments identified by OIG should be waived because HPBC relied on the clinical judgments of the benefi ciaries’ certifying physicians; therefore, HPBC had a reasonable basis to believe the Medicare payments were correct. HPBC also stated that OIG’s overpayment must be reduced to offset amounts for items and services (e.g., durable medical equipment, phar maceuticals, and supplies ) that would otherwise be payable by Medicare had the beneficiary not elected hospice. We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We also reviewed the report prepared by HPBC ’s statistical expert and maintain that our sampling methodology and extrapolation were statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC . However, we note that OIG audit 34 Accordingly, HPBC does not believe it was overpaid for hospice services except for three claims for which it agreed that it received excess SIA payments in error.  HPBC state d that it can quantify and will refund all SIA-related overpayments in the sampl ing frame; therefore, they state these claims cannot be included in the projected disallowance.

The action official —in this case, CMS— may reexamine claims that we have recommended disallowing and determine whether an overpayment exists and if the waiver provisions cited by HPBC apply. Lastly, we did not reduce the overpayments we identified by amounts for services that HPBC stated would otherwise be payable by Medicare because we have no assur ance that Medicare would cover these services. A summary of HPBC ’s comments and our responses follows. HPBC ’s comments are included as Appendix E.35 MEDICARE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION HPBC Comments HPBC engaged an independent physician to analyze OIG’s m edical review contractor’s findings and conclusions .  According to HPBC, t he physician confirmed that the certifications of terminal illness and levels of care for beneficiaries associated with our sa mple claims were supported by medical records. Specifically, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor’s analyses were not supported by the medical records, contained factual errors, and failed to apply fundamental principles or cite relevant medical literature.  Further, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor used similar boilerplate language in its determination letters, which HPBC asserted was an indication of the contractor’s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and to thoroughly review the associated medical records. HPBC also claimed that the medical review contractor “ cherry -picked ” discrete bits of information to support its decisions while disregarding other facts in the record that supported the beneficiaries’ terminal prognosis. Lastly, HPBC argued that the medical review process was flawed because it only included a review of 1 month of records (or less) for each hospice patient, which does not provide a complete medical picture of a beneficiary’s condition. Office of Inspector General Response We maintain that the clinical records submitted by HPBC for the sample claims questioned in our draft report did not meet Medicare requirements. Despite using boilerplate language, t he independent medical review contractor properly used the appropriate statutory and regulatory hospice criteria, including applicable Local Coverage Determination (LCD) guidelines, as the framework for its determinations.  Specifically, the medical review contractor applied standards set out in 42 C FR § 418.22(b)(2), which require clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis to accompany the certification and be filed in the med ical 35 HPBC included multiple exhibits as part of its comments.  These exhibits includ ed a statement by the physician engaged by the hospice, the engaged physician’s curricula vitae, a claim -by-claim rebuttal of the findings in our draft report, its statistical expert’s report on our sampling methodology , and the statistical expert’s curricula vitae. Although the exhibits are not included as appendices in our final report, we considered the entirety of these documents in preparing our final report and will provide HPBC’s comments in their entirety to CMS. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 9                                                                                                                                                                    record. The contractor did not cite medical literature because it audited to Medicare requirements and medical literature is not considered a Medicare requirement . Further, contrary to HPBC’s assertion , the medical review contractor did not review o nly 1 month ’s worth of records (or less) for each hospice patient or “cherry -pick” information .  Rather, the contractor evaluated the entire medical record provided by the hospice for each sample claim to determine whether Medicare requirements were met. This included, but was not limited to, hospice election records; the initial certification of terminal illness; recertifications that covered the sample claim; plans of care ; medication records; physician, nurse, hospice aide , and social worker notes; hosp ital medical records (if applicable) ; and billing documents .  When the medical records and other available clinical factors supported the physician’s medical prognosis or the level of hospice care provided, the medical review contractor determined that Medicare requirements were met. MEDI CAL REVIEW CONTRACTOR ’S DETERMINATIONS HPBC Comments HPBC asserted th at the independent medical review contractor failed to apply many well-established hospice principles and the appropriate standards governing hospice eligibility. Specifically, HPBC stated that it was improper for the medical review contractor to deny a claim solely on the basis that there was no decline in the beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement. HPBC further alleged that t he cont ractor’s determination s were made using the benefit of hindsight and not on the information known at the time the care was provided.  In addition, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor denied hospice benefits because the contractor relied on a predetermined list of clinical benchmarks that are not required to support a terminal prognosis.  Further, HPBC claimed that the medical review contactor relied on LCDs to determine whether a beneficiary met hospice eligibility requirements and that it improperly denied a claim when the ben eficiary’s condition did not meet an LCD. As examples, HPBC described four sample claims (numbers 8, 9, 72, and 78) for which it believed the associated beneficiaries’ certifications of terminal illness and levels of care were supported by medical records but were considered unallowable by the independent medical review contractor.36 Lastly, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor failed to apply the law consistent with the 2019 Unite d States v. AseraCare , Inc. decision.37 According to HPBC, AseraCare states that “a certifying hospice physician’s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit” and that “medical record supporting a physician’s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment.” 36 In exhibits attached to its comme nts, HPBC included what it described as “Patient Response Summaries” rebutting the claims denied or partially denied by the independent medical review contractor. 37 938 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2019). Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 10                                                                                                                                                                  Office of Inspector General Response We disagree with HPBC’s assertions that the independent medical review contractor failed to apply appropriate Medicare hospice requirements (i.e., laws and regulations) when conducting its review and that its determinations of terminal status were inconsis tent with hospice coverage requirements. As previously mentioned, the medical review contractor appropriately applied the standards set out in 42 CFR § 418.22(b)(2) to determine whether terminal prognosis was supported.  In those determinations, the contr actor considered the certifying physician’s terminal diagnosis, as well the medical records provided by the hospice for each sample claim, guided by questions rooted in the Medicare requirements and the clinical knowledge of a licensed physician who specializes in hospice and palliative medicine and is familiar with Medicare hospice guidelines and protocols. The medical review contractor did not deny a claim because there was no decline in the associated beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement. Rather, it evaluated all clinical conditions presented in the medical records collectively to obtain an overall clinical picture of the beneficiary and, based on the information that was available and known at the time of certification or recertification, determined whether hospice eligibility requirements were met .  We acknowledge that hospice care may still be appropriate for some beneficiaries who did not meet guidelines detailed in LCDs, based upon an individual assessment of the beneficiaries’ health status.  Accordingly, the independent medical review contactor merely used LCD guidelines as a tool to evaluate terminal prognosis.  Finally, it was the opinion of OIG’s medical reviewer contractor that the documentation in the m edical records did not always support the terminal prognosis. Regarding the four sample claims that HPBC described in its comments as incorrectly determined to be unallowable, we note that the independent medical review contractor determined that the associated medical records did not support the terminal prognosis or the need for the level of hospice care provided. Therefore, we mai ntain that the medical review contractor consistently and appropriately applied Medicare hospice eligibility requirements. Specifically: • Sample claim number 8: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had numerous prognos es that impact ed comorbid and secondary conditions , as well as unintentional weight loss. However, the independent medical review contractor determined that there was no documentation of secondary conditions38 and that the beneficiary had gained weight since admission.  Therefore, the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported. • Sample claim number 9: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had several comorbid and secondary conditions that contribut ed to her terminal prognosis and that she lost 10.4 percent of her body weight in under 2 months.  However, the independent 38 Such as stage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Therefore, the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported. • Sample claim number 72: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary required a higher level of care due to labored breathing and elevated heart rate in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain.  However, the medical review contractor determined that although the medical file documented that the beneficiary was imminently dying and unresponsive, the symptoms were being well controlled on scheduled subcutaneous (i.e., not intravenous) doses of morphine. The beneficiary was not in crisis ; therefore, the predominance of services provided d id not require nursing support.  As a result, the continuous home care services provided was not required . • Sample claim number 78: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary’s unstable medical condition and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure required around -the-clock monitoring by a nurse and frequent administration of several intravenous medication s.  However, the medical review contractor determined the beneficiary’s medical condition did not warrant a short -term inpatient stay for pain control or ac ute or chronic symptom management that could not feasibly be provided in other settings. Specifically, t he medical file did not document that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered.  Rather, medication was administered subcutaneously , which does not require an inpatient setting.  Therefore, the general inpatient care services provided were not required. In addition to its exhibits , which include d a claim- by-claim rebuttal, HPBC’s comments included several examples that, according to HPBC, demonstrate that the medical review contractor improperly denied claims because beneficiaries’ conditions had not declined or their conditions had improved or st abilized .  HPBC stated that the contractor did not base the ir determinations from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. For these examples, we maintain that the medical review contractor determin ed that the associated medical f ile did not support a terminal prognosis of 6 months or less or that the level of care provided was required .  For example, for sample claim number 58, HPBC state d that the medical review contractor denied hospice eligibility for a 90 -year -old beneficiary who weighed 100 pounds but began to eat all of her meals because she was given an appetite stimulate despite having a primary diagnosis of cerebral atherosclerosis (i.e., a neurological condition) for which the LCD does not requir e any weight loss or poor appetite.  Further, the medical review contractor noted that there was no evidence of significant decline.  However, we note that the medical review contractor also determined that the there was no documentation of secondary condi tions (e.g., stage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis ).  In addition, the beneficiary was alert and the documentation supported improved and healing of a stage 2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Therefore, the medical review contractor determined that the medical file did not support a prognosis of 6 months or less. We also disagree with HPBC’ s AseraCare -based assertion that the eligibility determination can be questioned only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the hospice benefit. To the contrary, in AseraCare , the Eleventh Circuit rejected the Government’s concern that, under the court’s reading of the eligibility framework, if a physician certified a patient as terminally ill, CMS would be required to reimburse the hospice provider unless CMS could determine that no other reviewer could possibly conclude the patient was terminally ill.39 Although th e AseraCare case was about the circumstances under which certifications of terminal illness could be deemed false for purposes of Federal False Claims Act liability, the Eleventh Circuit clearly acknowledged that CMS is statutorily prohibited from paying f or services that are not reasonable and necessary for the palliation or management of terminal illness and that CMS retains a well- established right to review and deny payments for claims that do not meet that standard. Accordingly, we maintain the validity of our findings . OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL SAMPLING METHODOLOGY HPBC Comments HPBC challenged the validity of our statistical sampling and extrapolation methodologies, engaged a statistical expert to review OIG’s sampling methodology, and pr ovided a copy of the statistical expert’s re port. HPBC stated that extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication. HPBC also stated that OIG’s statistical methodolo gy was fundamentally flawed and the extrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid. According to HPBC ’s statistical expert: (1) OIG did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample, (2) OIG’s sample size was too small to yield an accurate estimate of a two-sided 90 -percent confidence interval and standard precision of 10 percent, (3) the sample units w ere not statistically independent because OIG sample d by claim— not b y beneficiary or episode of care, (4) OIG improperly excluded zero -paid claims from its universe, and (5) the payment error rate is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolatio n.  Lastly, HPBC stated that the SIA payments identified as unsupported in o ur draft report were due to a Palmetto system error as well as an electronic medical record (EMR) system error. HPBC stated that it can quantify total SIA overpayment s in the sampling frame through a case -by-case review; therefore, OIG is not permitted to use sampling to estimate this amount. Office of Inspector General Response After reviewing the statistical expert’s report, we maintain that our sampling and extrapolation methodologies are statistically valid.  Federal courts have consistently upheld statistical 39 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1295 . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 13                                                                                                                                                        sampling and extrapolation as a valid means to determine overpaymen t amounts in Medicare and Medicaid.40 The legal standard for use of sampling and extrapolation is that it must be based on a statistically valid methodology, not the most precise methodology.41 We properly executed our statistical sampling methodology i n that we defined our sampling frame and sample unit, randomly selected our sample, applied relevant criteria in evaluating the sample, and used statistical sampling software (i.e., RAT -STATS) to apply the correct formulas for the extrapolation. The stati stical lower limit that we use for our recommended recovery represents a conservative estimate of the overpayment that we would have identified if we had reviewed each and every claim in the sampling frame.  The conservative nature of our estimate is not c hanged by the nature of the errors identified in this audit. Moreover, the court cases that HPBC ’s attorney referenced in support of the proposition that extrapolation is inappropriate for individualized prognostication in hospices42 are limited to False Claims Act cases and therefore are inapplicable to OIG audit recommendations and CMS recoveries arising from OIG audits. The statistical expert’s claim that OIG did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample is not c orrect.  Following the exit conference, we provided HPBC with several workpapers, including, but not limited to, the sampling plan, sampling frame, random number seed , and selected sample items.43 Therefore, we maintain that HPBC has the information it needs to recreate the sampling frame and identify the individual sample items.44 The statistical expert’s statement that OIG’s sample was too small to yield an accurate estimate is not correct.  Small sample sizes (e.g., smaller t han 100 ) have routinely been upheld by the 40 See Yorktown Med. Lab., Inc. v. Perales , 948 F.2d 84 (2d Cir. 1991); Illinois Physicians Union v.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 14                                                                                                                                                                     Departmental Appeals Board and Federal courts.45 The legal standard for a sample size is that it must be sufficient to be statistically valid, not that it be the most precise methodology.46 Sample size is incorp orated into the computation of the confidence interval, with a smaller sample size generally resulting in a smaller lower limit. Because absolute precision is not required, any imprecision in the sample may be remedied by recommending recovery at the lowe r limit, which was done in this audit.47 This approach results in an estimate that is lower than the actual overpayment amount 95 percent of the time, and thus it generally favors the provider.48 Additionally, we disagree with HPBC statistical expert’s statement that the sample unit used for this audit is not statistically independent because OIG sampled by claim and not beneficiary. The proofs for the unbiased nature of our estimate and the conse rvative nature of the lower limit require random selection of the sample units (in this case, claims). We performed this selection using a valid random number generator.  The proofs underlying our methods do not make any assumptions about the distribution of beneficiaries in the sampling frame or in the sample.49 We also disagree that OIG violated statistical principles by excluding zero -paid claims from the universe.50 Generally, OIG may perform a statistical or non -statistical review of a provider without covering all claims from that provider.  Further, when extrapolation is used, OIG only projects to the sampling frame from which the sample was drawn.  Therefore, contrary to HPBC’ s assertion, a valid sampling frame does not need to include all zero -paid claims within the audit period. HPBC assert s that any r ecoupment amount extrapolated from a sample must ultimately comply with the requirements of the MPIM to be enforceable. However, a s HPBC acknowledges in its 45 See Anghel v. Sebelius , 912 F. Supp. 2d 4 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (upholding a sample size of 95 claims); Transyd Enters., LLC v . Sebelius , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42491 (S.D.

The text provides the detailed proofs underlying design- based sampling methods for stratified and simple random sampling used by OIG. The type of independence cited by HPBC is not referenced in any of these proofs. 50 In the exhibit report , HPBC’s statistical expert relied heavily on CMS’s Medicare Program Integrity Manual (MPIM) , which does not apply to OIG (as acknowledged by the statistical expert on page 4 of the HPBC’s e xhibit). However, we note that MPIM , ch. 8, § 8.4.3.2 expressly allows for the removal of claims/claim lines attributable to sample units for which there was no payment.

Lastly, we disagree with HPBC ’s assertion that OIG is not permitted to include SIA overpayment amounts in the estimate of total improper payments because HPBC states it is able to identify all impacted claims and quantify the overpayment through a case -by-case review . The estimate presented in this report represents the total amount of all improper Medicare payments made to HPBC for hospice services in our sampling frame, it does not represent a specific SIA overpayment amount . However, CMS, acting through a Medicare administrative contractor or other contractor, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures. We will calculate any alternate estimates as necessary to assist CMS in this process. 51 See the Act § 1893(f)(3); CMS MPIM, Pub. No. 100 -08, ch. 8, § 8.4, (effective January 2, 2019).

These claims were extracted from CMS’s National Claims History (NCH) file. We did not assess HPBC’s overall internal control structure. Rather, we limited our review of internal controls to those applicable to our objective. Our audit enabled us to establish reasonable assurance of the authenticity and accuracy of the data obtained from the NCH file , but we did not assess the completeness of the file. We performed fieldwork from October 2019 to December 2021. METHODOLOGY To accomplish our objective, we: • reviewed applicable Medicare laws, regulations, and guidance ; • met with CMS officials to gain an understanding of the Medicare hospice benefit; • had discussions with Palmetto officials to gain an understanding of the Medicare requirements related to hospice services; • met with HPBC’s officials to gain an understanding of its policies and procedures related to providing and billing Medicare for hospice services and reviewed those policies and procedures ; • obtained 37,153 hospice claims , totaling $149,994,36452 from the CMS NCH file, for the audit period ; • excluded 32 claims, totaling $ 144,228, that were identified in the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party; • created a sampling frame consist ing of 37,121 hospice claims, totaling $ 149,850,136 ; • selected a random sample of 100 hospice claims from the sampling frame; 52 The hospice claims extract ed from the CMS NCH file had a payment from the Medicare Trust Fund; however, an individual line can have a zero payment.

SAMPLE UNIT The sample unit was a Medicare Part A hospice claim. SAMPLE DESIGN We used a simple random sample. SAMPLE SIZE We selected a sample of 100 Medicare Part A hospice claims. SOURCE OF THE RANDOM NUMBERS We generated the random numbers with the OIG , Office of Audit Services (OAS) statistical software. METHOD FOR SELECTING SAMPLE ITEMS We consecutively numbered the hospice claims in our sampling frame.  After generating 100 random numbers, we selected the corresponding frame items. ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY We used the OIG/OAS statistical software to estimate the total amount of improper Medicare paymen ts made to HPBC for hospice services in our sampling frame .  To be conservative, we recommend recovery of overpayments at the lower limit of a two -sided 90 -percent confidence interval.  Lower limits calculated in this manner are designed to be less than the actual improper payment total 95 percent of the time. 53 The sampling frame included claims for which a payment was made from the Medicare Trust Fund and claims that were not identified in the RAC data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party.

Javits Federal Building 26 Federal Plaza, Room 3900 New York, NY 10278 Re: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. A-02-20-01001 Dear Ms. Tierney: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (\"HPBC\") appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General\\'s (\"OIG\\'s\") draft report entitled Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (\"Draft Report\"). HPBC\\'s comments to the Draft Report, including the report\\'s conclusions and recommendations , are set forth below.1 INTRODUCTION HPBC is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in Florida, having been established in 1978 by communit y leaders to provide end-of-life care for the area\\'s aging population. Its long\\xadtenured leadership team has over 100 years in combined hospice experience. HPBC is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in Florida, and it was also one of the first 100 hospices to become Medicare-certified. It has also earned The Joint Commiss ion accreditation for meeting the highest performance standards of care, and it created a nationally-r ecognized Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship Program for physicians wishing to specialize in hospice care. 1 This letter and Exhibits 1-2 and 40-41 do not include any protected health information (\"PHI\\'\\'), and therefore we ask that they be attached as an appendix to the OIG\\'s final audit report once it is made public. Exhibits 3-39 do contain PHI, and we ask that these exhibits not be included within the publicly available version of the OIG\\'s final audit report. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 APPENDIX E: HPBC COMMENTS Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 23      BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 2 From a review of only 0.269%2 of the claims for payment that this non-profit hospice submitted to Medicare over a two-year period, the OIG has concluded that it received an alleged overpayment of $42,336,162. This conclusion is based on a review of limited patient medical records by a Medical Review Contractor retained by the OIG to assess whether HPBC admitted patients who qualified for hospice, i.e., had a medical prognosis that his or her life expectanc y is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course, and whether those patients were afforded the appropriate level of care. But, the Medical Review Contractor failed to adhere to the law and standards of practice when reviewing HPBC\\'s claims, and many of its summaries contain factual errors. In response to this Draft Report, HPBC engaged an independent physician who is well\\xadqualified in hospice medicine to evaluate its patient records and the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor \\'s assessments of the claims at issue. This independent expert physician has confirmed that HPBC\\'s patient records supported the reasonable clinical judgments of the HPBC physicians who certified that the patients at issue were eligible for hospice and who determined each patient\\'s appropriate level of hospice care. Significantly, as with other hospice physicians reviewing similar OIG audits, this physician has expressed concern over the apparent lack of understanding of hospice medicine reflected in the Medical Review Contractor \\'s assessments. The Contractor \\'s assessments are misleading, incomplete, focus on irrelevant data points, and, most importantl y, fail to provide any explanation regarding how those data points relate to each patient\\'s prognosis. As detailed in these comments, the Medical Review Contractor clearly disregarded numerous hospice principles set out in CMS guidance documents . It is our understanding the OIG has not independently requested from, nor verified, proof of the qualifications of the physicians or clinicians used by its Medical Review Contractor to review hospice claims. The OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor also failed to apply the appropriate standards for assessing patient eligibility established by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. AseraCare, Jnc.3 Specifically, theAseraCare court explained that a certifying hospice physician\\'s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only ifno reasonable physician , applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit.4 Nothing within the Medical Review Contractor\\'s decisions make this necessary showing. Rather, the Medical Review Contractor merely cherry\\xadpicked discrete bits of information to rationalize its decisions while ignoring the patients\\' overall 2 The OIG reviewed 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims for 1,556 patients cared for by HPBC from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019.

Contrary to AseraCare, the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor failed to give any deference to the certifying hospice physicians, resulting in the unsupported conclusion that the clinical judgments made by more than 28 different hospice physicians, many of whom have over a decade ( or two) of hospice experience, are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine , and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine ,5 were wrong when certifying these patients, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. 6 This illogical result is possibly explained by the flawed review process. As explained in these comments , the process used by the OIG to evaluate medical necessity may work well for most Medicare items or services, but it is incompatibl e with hospice services. Likewise , the statistical extrapolation process employed by the OIG to convert its review of less than one-half of one percent of HPBC \\'s claims to an overpayment totaling tens of millions of dollars is unfounded. Statistical extrapolation is an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of the practice of hospice medicine because of the individualized nature of prognostication. Even if ell.1rapolation were appropriate, the sampling and extrapolation in this matter have been determined by an expert statistician to be invalid for a number of reasons, any one of which wan-ants the OIG\\'s reconsideration of its use of the sampling and extrapolation to determine the estimated overpayment. The Social Security Act (\"Act\") also supports waiver of the overpaymen ts in this case pursuant to federal law because HPBC submitted the claims at issue in reliance on the clinical judgments of the certifying physicians, which are not shown by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor\\'s summaries to be unreasonable. Lastly, the Draft Report does not include a required offset based on items and services for which there is no dispute regarding medical necessity, such as durable medical equipment, pharmacy, radiology, and labs that Medicare is required to cover regardless of whether the patient was terminally ill. Overall, the Draft Report will significantly decrease beneficiary access to the hospice benefit if it is not reconsidered and revised. If hospices and physicians were to use the criteria and standards used by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor, it will mean some of the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries will not be able to access hospice care until they are showing signs and symptoms of actively dying, which is directly contrary to the intent of Congress and CMS. 7 The active dying process occurs over hours or days, whereas the Medicare hospice 5 For example, six claims denied by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor are associated with four physicians who have over 10 years\\' experience and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Two of these physicians also teach hospice medicine. A total of 22 claims that were denied involve patients certified by physicians with over 10 years of experience in hospice medicine. 6 Of the 30 patients denied based on eligibility, two were over I 00 years old, 14 were ages 90-99, and nine were between 86-89 years old. 7 CMS revised the hospice regulations in 1990 to encourage physicians to certify more patients for hospice. See 55 Fed. Reg. 50832 (Dec. 11, 1990); see also GAO, Program Provisions and Payments Discourage Hospice Participation (Sept 29, 1989), available athttp://gao.gov/products/HRD-89-l l l.

Beneficiaries should not suffer and be denied access to comfort care as a result of an ill-fitted audit process carried out by an unidentified reviewer whose qualifications and experience are in serious doubt. In light of the foregoing, and as discussed in detail below, the OIG\\'s audit is fundamentall y flawed in numerous respects and, as a result, its overpayment determination is invalid. For these reasons, we respectfully request that the OIG reconsider the claim decisions and the conclusions made in the Draft Report. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON HPBC The Draft Audit Report is wholly inconsistent with HPBC\\'s history, leadership, accreditation, reputation, and culture of compliance. As a historical and locally-based non-profit, with its sole mission to provide families in the community with access to compassionate and quality hospice services, HPBC has taken all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the Medicare program. HPBC is a non-profit hospice that was originally formed by a group of community leaders in 1978 to provide end-of-life care for everyone who needed it, regardless of their ability to pay or financial status. This was before the Medicare hospice benefit existed. At that time, it was one of the first hospices in the area. When Medicare created the hospice benefit in 1983, recognizing the benefits and cost-savings associated with end-of-life care, HPBC became one of the first 100 hospices to be certified. In 2014, HPBC joined together with its sister-location Hospice by the Sea to form Trustbridge, Inc. (formerly known as Spectrum Health, Inc.). Trustbrid ge is currently the largest provider of hospice care in the area. In 2009, HPBC became one of the only hospices to earn The Joint Commission \\'s Gold Seal of Approval for Home Care Accreditation, meaning it has met the most rigorous quality and safety standards of care for patients. As a non-profit corporatio n, HPBC is governed by a Board of Directors, comprised of 10 volunteers from the local community. The members of the Board of Directors are highly credentialed and are actively engaged in HPBC\\'s efforts to provide quality care in compliance with all state and federal laws. The Board is currently chaired by Ms. Barbara Bolton Litten, Esq. Ms. Litten has been a business litigation attorney for over 26 years. Prior to becoming an attorney, she was the Chief Executive Officer of a large not-for-profit corporation based in Southwest Florida. She has been a member of the Board of Directors since 2010. Prior to her becoming chair, Mr. Randy Levitt served in that capacity. Mr. Levitt is a Senior Vice President at Morgan Stanley and is both a CPA and attorney. He served as chairman from 2017 to 2021 and remains on the Board. Two other members of the board are healthcare regulatory attorneys, Marian Pealman Nease and Heather Miller.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 26    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 5 In addition to its Board of Directors, HPBC \\'s current leadership team is very experienced in hospice care and active in the industry. Mr. David Fielding has been the President and Chief Executive Officer since 1998. Prior to taking this role 24 years ago, Mr. Fielding held leadership positions with two other large hospice companies for 9 years. Dr. Faustino Gonzale z, Chief Medical Officer and Medical Director for HPBC, is board-certified in Internal Medicine with an added qualification in Hospice & Palliative Medicine. He has also been a Fellow of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine since 2010. He has over 21 years\\' experience in hospice care, and he has published over 13 peer-review articles and has given more than a dozen presentations at various conferences and symposiums on end-of-life and palliative care, including presentations for the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and the Veterans Administration. HPBC provides exemplary and compliant care to its patients, evidenced by its Gold Seal of Approval for Home Care Accreditation from The Joint Commi ssion, and its survey history. HPBC has been continuousl y accredited by The Joint Commission since 2009. HPBC had no condition-l evel findings on the last two surveys conducted by The Joint Commission in 2018 and 2022. HPBC is also regularly surveyed by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), the agency in Florida that licenses hospices, which is also the state survey agency for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). HPBC had no deficiencies representing serious or immediate risk or harm to patients during the time period at issue or after. Because of its reputation for providing high quality care, HPBC was able to join in a consortium with the Universit y of Miami Miller School of Medicine , JFK Medical Center, and West Palm Beach Veterans Administration Center to create a Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship program. This fellowship program prepares physicians for board-certification in hospice and palliative medicine and was nationally accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2010. As part of a large organization, HPBC has very robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance plan. The OIG confirmed during its exit interview that it had not identified any particular flaw or problem with these policies and procedures. The Draft Report similarly does not identify any specific policy or procedure that is improper or requires modification. Rather, the Draft Report generally indicates HPBC\\'s policies and procedures were ineffective, despite the OIG\\'s own statements there were no particular flaw or problem with the policies.8 HPBC\\'s policies and procedures regarding certification of hospice eligibility are based on the federal statutes and regulations, requiring that the physician determine the patient\\'s eligibility 8 The OIG\\' s position in the Draft Report appears to result from the conclusions of the Medical Review Contractor. In other words, the OIG has concluded that there must be something wrong with HPBC\\'s policies and procedures because the Medical Review Contractor found reason to deny or down-code certain claims. The OIG ignores the more likely explanation: the Medical Review Contractor denied or down-coded claims because the Medical Review Contractor failed to properly apply basic tenets of hospice medicine in a manner consistent with the Medicare hospice benefit. See Exhibit 1, Physician Statement of Dr. Leedy Regarding the OIG\\'s Audit of Hospice of Palm Beach County Inc. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 27    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 6 based on the physician\\'s clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the patient\\'s terminal illness. As required by law, HPBC\\'s policies require the physician to prepare a brief written narrative reflecting the patient\\'s clinical circumstances justifying the terminal prognosis , and expressly require that the clinical information supporting the terminal prognosis be documented in the medical record. All of these patients had signed certifications in which their treating physicians attested that they had a terminal prognosis based on those physicians\\' clinical judgment. Nothing in the policies and procedures encourages or incentivizes physicians or hospice staff to certify ineligible patients for hospice. To the contrary, the policies make clear that if a patient is ineligible, a more appropriate referral will be made. HPBC has taken steps to implement and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures through regular education of its Board members, leadership , physicians, and staff. HPBC has a director of excellenc e and knowledge who coordinates for all physicians and staff necessary training to provide quality care in compliance with the Medicare requirements. During the time period at issue, the HPBC physicians were required to attend education on interdisciplinary group meetings and documentation standards, an annual two-part Rapid Regulatory Compliance program through HealthStream, which included corporate compliance; and Relias LLC educational sessions on physician narratives and relatedness determinations. HPBC\\'s other clinical staff also attended the two-part Rapid Regulatory Complianc e program through HealthStr eam, sessions on prognosti cation tools and hospice eligibility, and several Relias LLC educational sessions touching on the Medicare hospice benefit and its requirements. Physicians and staff alike attend training sessions any time HPBC\\'s policies and procedures are updated. In addition to this training, HPBC\\'s Complianc e Plan ensures the effectiveness of its policies, procedures, and practices. HPBC\\'s Compliance Plan is consistent with the OIG\\'s guidance9 and memorializes the commitm ent of HPBC\\'s Board of Directors and all hospice staff to actively participate and uphold the hospice\\'s commitm ent to compliance. Board members and HPBC\\'s leadership attend annual training on the Compliance Plan. There is also a dedicated, full-time Corporate Compliance Officer, who is supported by a Compliance Department made up of a full-time Director of Compliance and two full-time compliance nurses. In addition to its full-time Complian ce Officer and Compliance Department , HPBC has a Compliance Steering Committee, which provides oversight and direction on regulatory requirement s. The Compliance Department conducts an annual risk assessment, identifying potential areas of risk using internal audit findings as well as governmental guidance and opinions, to develop an audit plan. It then conducts internal audits based on this plan and frequentl y engages outside consultants to conduct reviews. The results of these reviews are documented, trended, and reported to the Compliance Steering Committe e, CEO, the Governance Committee, and the 9 See OIG, Compliance Guidance, http//oig.hhs.gov/compliance/compliance-guidance/index.asp. HPBC confinned with legal counsel in 2018 that its Compliance Plan met both the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines and the OIG\\'s guidelines.

During the time period at issue, audits were conducted on the use of general inpatient (\"GIP\") care for five or more days, crisis care provided for longer than three days, and patients with a length of stay longer than 180 days. These audits were conducted by pulling a sample on a weekly or bi-monthly basis. Staff counseling and education is conducted if the results reveal a pattern or trend. In addition to conducting audits based on its annual risk assessment, the Compliance Department also conducts investigations based on reports it receives through various sources. All physicians , staff, and volunteers are provided with a Compliance Hotline number to report concerns related to compliance. This toll-free Compliance Hotline number is maintained by a third-party contractor to ensure anonymit y, and it is posted throughout the HPBC offices. The Compliance Department also hosts a \"Complianc e and Ethics Week\" every November, during which staff participate in games designed to educate them on the Compliance Plan and where or how to report compliance concerns, including the Compliance Hotline. All staff members are also asked to review HPBC\\'s Conflict of Interest/Code of Conduct Policy every year and complete an attestation form that asks staff members to disclose compliance-r elated issues. Because of HPBC\\'s culture emphasizing compliance , most compliance reports are received directly by the Corporate Complian ce Officer or Director of Complianc e. A review of the HPBC\\'s reports and internal audits and investigations does not reveal any pattern or systemic problems with respect to eligibility or level of care determinations.10 The effectiveness of the hospice\\'s policies and procedur es and Compliance Plan are demonstrated by CMS \\'s PEPPER reports. PEPPER11 reports provide statistics for key markers used to identify qu estionable billing practices so that hospices may target and improve problematic areas. The reports include data on live discharges, long lengths of stay, 12 and top five diagnoses. For the target areas related to certification of potentiall y ineligible patients, HPBC has been far below the percentile that CMS deems a high risk for improper payments (the 80th percentile). With respect to long lengths of stay, HPBC \\'s PEPPER repo1i for the three federal fiscal years through fiscal year 201913 showed that only 10.1 % of its patients had a long length of stay, putting HPBC in the 19.8 percentile nationwide. This means 80.2% of hospices nationwide had a higher percentage of patients with long lengths of stay as compared to HPBC 10 HPBC\\'s culture of compliance is further demonstrated by voluntary repayments made in the past in response to its internal investigations. On December 22, 2017, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto in the amount of $91,623.83 for evaluation and management services performed by physician, Dr. Randy Fox, which were determined to be potential overpayments using a statistically valid random sample. On March 4, 2020, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration after determining physician narratives for two patients were potentially defective. On March 18, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto for GIP claims submitted for three patients that were determined to be potential overpayments following an internal investigation that involved detailed chart reviews. 11 Program for Evaluating Payment Patterns Electronic Report (\"PEPPER\"). tz Long Length of Stay patients are those whose combined days of service is greater than 180 days. 13 For federal fiscal year (\"FY\") 2019 (October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019).

In other words, the PEPPER reports reflect HPBC surpassed most other hospices with respect to accurate prognosticati on. HPBC recognize s that, like all providers, it is not infallible. However, its history, leadership, policies and procedures, Compliance Plan, ongoing staff and physician education, and overall culture make it apparent that any issues that occur are aberrant and far from widespread. The OIG\\'s conclusion to the contrary ignores HPBC\\'s background, policies, and culture and is indicative of an overzealous medical review contractor that appears to lack a clear understanding of the hospice standard of practice, as well as the statutes and regulations governing hospice. IfOIG\\'s conclusion were correct, it would mean that the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians , who personally treated the patients and had absolutely no incentive to improperly admit them for hospice care, was incorrect. Such conclusion lacks credibility when considering the foregoing information. RESPONSE TO THE OIG\\'S DRAFT REPORT I. Swnmary of the Draft Report In this audit, the OIG reviewed a very narrow snapshot ofHPBC \\'s overall operat ions. As a part of its audit, the OIG selected a random sample of 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims submitted by HPBC for the time period of April 2017 to March 2019, which represents 0.269% of the claims submitted by HPBC for that time period. The 100 claims selected by the OIG were associated with only one month (or less) of hospice services provided to 100 different hospice patients. During that time period, HPBC provided hospice care to 12,762 Medicare beneficiaries and received $149,850,136 in Medicare reimbursement. After requesting and receiving records from HPBC for these 100 patients for this one month or less of service, the OIG then had its Medical Review Contractor review the records. The OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor determined that 60 of the claims met all Medicare requirements, while 40 of the claims did not. Of those 40 claims, 30 were denied because the Medical Review Contractor concluded that records accompanying the properly signed physician certification or recertification did not support the medical prognosis of a terminal illness; 7 were downcoded from a higher level of care to the routine home care level of care because, although the patient was clinically eligible for hospice services, the Medical Review Contractor concluded that the documentation did not support the higher level of care; and three were partially denied because the Medical Review Contractor concluded that the service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") payment was not supported.14 14 As a result of the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC learned of an error in its E.MR system that created minor Service Intensity Add-on (\"SIA\") overpayments for some patients. Due to the nature of the technological issue, HPBC is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 30    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 9 The OIG extrapolated the error rate for the sample of claims determined by its Medical Review Contractor to the entire universe of claims submitted by HPBC to Medicare during the two-year time frame for this audit. As a result of the extrapolation, the OIG alleges in its Draft Report that HPBC received approximately $42,336,162 in improper payments. Nothing in the Draft Report suggests that HPBC acted fraudulently or that it knowingly submitted incorrect information to the government. The OIG concludes its report by making three recommendations: (1) refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. In the next sections of this letter, HPBC provides its analysis of the Draft Report and then responds to these recommendations. II, Analysis of the OIG\\'s Audit Process and Determinations A. The Clinical Documentation for the Claims Reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor Met All Requirements . HPBC provided properly signed and clinically supported physician certifications and recertifications for each patient whose claim was denied by the Medical Review Contractor. HPBC also provided documentation demonstrating that the patients who received a higher level of hospice care in fact required that level of care. Highly trained and experienced physicians signed these certifications and made level of care determinations using their clinical judgment, basing their judgment on the patients\\' conditions. This audit involves rejection of the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians who personally treated the patients at issue, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. Many of these physicians have worked in hospice for years and are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine. Some of them are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, the highest honor that can be bestowed on a Board-certified hospice physician. Some of them even teach hospice and palliative medicine. Rejecting the clinical judgments of these physicians impugns their expertise and reputation. HPBC engaged an independent physician with impeccable credentials, Dr. Stephen A. Leedy, MD, MA, HMDC, F AAHPM, to further analyze the Medical Review Contractor\\'s findings and conclusions. 15 Dr. Leedy assessed the medical records that were provided to the OIG and confirmed, as set forth in the individual patient responses included with this letter (\"Patient Response Summarie s\"), 16 that the certifications of terminal illness and the levels of care overpayment amount. Once it has completed this quantifica tion, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Palmetto the total SIA overpayment amount. 15 See Exhibit 2, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Leedy. 16 See Exhibits3-39. These exhibits are comprised ofHPBC\\'sresponses to the bases for the OIG\\'s claim denials. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 31    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 10 for those patients were supported by the medical records. These conclusions by Dr. Leedy are supported by his extensive experience with hospice, as well as peer-reviewed medical literature, to which he cites in the Patient Response Summaries.17 The Medical Review Contractor\\'s decisions for these patients, on the other hand, are not supported by the medical records, are rife with factual errors, fail to apply fundamental principles of hospice medicine as recognized by the medical community, and fail to include citation to any relevant medical literature. The Medical Review Summaries use the same or similar boilerplate language for each claim at issue, which is indicative of the Contractor\\'s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and thoroughly review the medical records provided by HPBC. This approach evidences a results-oriented outcome approach in which the Contractor cherry-picked discrete bits of information to support its denials while disregarding other facts in the record supporting the patients\\' terminal prognoses. Dr. Leedy has provided a Physician Statement expressing his deep disappointment and concern over the lack of understanding of hospice eligibility reflected in the \"Rationale\" of the Medical Review Summaries.18 In his Physician Statement, Dr. Leedy details how the Contractor\\'s analyses are inconsistent with the standard of practice, undermine the purpose of hospice care, and are antithetical to the hospice benefit. He further describes how the Rationales across patients are contradictory and downplay or ignore key clinical data in favor of select details cherry-picked from the medical records. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s lack of understanding is best shown through the following examples: 17 Dr. Leedy cited to the following in the Patient Response Summaries: De Stefani, Pietraroia, Fernandes-Silva, et al., Observational Evidence for Unintentional Weight Loss in All-Cause Mortality and Major Cardiovascu lar Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis , 8 SCI.

This 92-year-old patient had a primary diagnosis of senile degeneration of the brain with a Functional Assessment Staging Tool (\"FAST\") score of7C and a Palliative Performanc e Scale (\"PPS\") score of only 30%, as well as numerous prognosis\\xadimpacting comorbid and secondary conditions, including osseous defects in her right shoulder and right leg, muscle weakness, and a coccygeal wound. She also required a potent transdermal opioid analgesic for hip and low back pain, and she suffered from anorexia, eating less than 25% of meals. During the denied month of service, she exhibited severe nutritional compromise, and multiple factors documented throughout the medical record support that she was significantly malnourish ed. Accordingly, Dr. Leedy concluded from his review of the medical record that this patient had a terminal prognosis during these dates of service and was appropriately certified. The Contractor provided several irrelevant clinical points to support the unfavorable decision, many of which indicated a misplaced focus on body mass index (\"BMI\"), which is not required to demonstrate hospice eligibility, to the exclusion of other information bearing on terminality. Specifically, the Contractor glossed over this patient\\'s unintention al weight loss of 4.6% of her body weight in only 6 weeks, her increased contractures and kyphosis that made it difficult to measure her height, her dysphagia, and her anorexia that impaired her nutritional intake. In addition to concluding that this patient was eligible, Dr. Leedy opined that the Contractor \"selectively ignored information in the medical record to reach a misguided conclusion .\" • Sample #9 -The Contractor determined Sample #9, who met the LCD guidelines, was not eligible for hospice services for dates of service September 29-30, 2017. This 78-year-old patient had a primary diagnosis offrontotemporal dementia with a FAST score of 7 A and several comorbid and secondary conditions contributing to her terminal prognosis. Notably, she had lost 10.4% of her body weight in under 2 months and was anorexic and cachectic. The Contractor relied on factually false and immaterial factors in finding her ineligible. For example, the Contractor noted \"that there was no documentation of ongoing weight loss,\" which is directly contradicted in the medical record and would have been apparent had the Contractor not artificially and inappropriately constrained the review to just two days of care. Similarly, despite acknowledging her FAST score of 7 A, which meets the applicable Palmetto LCD guidelines, the Contractor determined this patient to be ineligible, ignoring clinical factors indicating a progression towards 7C and downplaying the significance of her staggeringl y low BMI of just 16. Dr. Leedy concluded that this patient was eligible for hospice services and added that the Contractor \\'s \"woefully inadequate understand ing of the details of hospice eligibility, including what appears to be a complete lack of reference to LCD guidelines, and evidence of inadequate medical record review, calls into questions the validity of the review.\" HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

This 91-year-old patient had a primary hospice diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease and a PPS score of only 10%, meaning she was comatose and not consuming anything by mouth. Dr. Leedy concluded that she was eligible for CHC services during this three-day period because she required a higher level of care for the unstable vital signs oftachypnea (labored breathing) and tachycardia ( elevated heart rate), in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain. Notably, she died on the final day of the denied dates of service. Yet, the Contractor commented that the \"documentation does not support that she was in crisis.\" To the contrary, Dr. Leedy\\'s review of the records revealed \"clear signs of distress, including pain and dyspnea,\" which are \"exactly the situation that warrants CHC.\" In fact, the care provided in this case is \"an exemplar of the successful use of CHC,\" as the patient was able to die peacefully in her own home. • Sample #78 ~ The Contractor determined Sample #78 was not eligible for GIP care for dates of service September 1-8, 2017. This 81-year-old patient had a primary diaguosis of acute catastrophic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident and a PPS of 20% that further declined to 10% on September 3, 2017. He was admitted to hospice at the GIP level of care following an emergency room visit for a severe stroke and significant neurologic symptoms. Dr. Leedy agreed with the decision to initiate GIP services because this patient\\'s unstable medical condition (including worsening tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, pain, lung congestion, and agitation) and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure due to the severity of his brain damage required around\\xadthe-clock nursing monitoring and frequent administration of several intravenous medications. He died on the final day of the denied dates of service. The Contractor \\'s claim that \"[t]here is no documentation that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered\" is blatantly inaccurate. Moreover, the Contractor \\'s comment that \"[a]s needed medication was required rarely\" misrepresents this patient\\'s fragile condition and the need for frequent intervention. According to Dr. Leedy, it is incorrect to suggest that this patient was not eligible for GIP services because the many medications needed to control his worsening symptoms were promptly scheduled rather than administered on an as-needed basis. The irrationality of the above-referenced claim denials is perhaps explained by the flawed review process. HPBC\\'s independent expert physician has expressed concern with the OIG\\'s process ofreviewing only one month of records ( or less) for each hospice patient. Reviewing documents supporting a single claim may be appropriate for auditing the medical necessity of a single item or service, but it is not well suited for hospice, which involves prognostication of life HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 34    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 13 expectancy based on the patient\\'s \"complete medical picture\"19 and ongoing, multidisciplinary treatment. Conducting a limited review of only one month ( or less) of a hospice patient\\'s records does not provide a \"complete medical picture\" of the patient\\'s condition to allow for prognostication within the standard of practice. Dr. Leedy confirms this in his Physician Statement. Although he believes the records reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor adequately supported the patients\\' eligibility and level of care, the OIG should have sought and reviewed the patients\\' other records ifthere was any doubt concerning their eligibility or level of care. Compounding this issue is the fact that this limited review was performed by someone whose name and credentials are unknown to the OIG. Taking into consideration the clinical judgment of the original certifying physicians, the attached Patient Response Summari es prepared by Dr. Leedy, and Dr. Leedy\\'s Physician Statement, it is apparent there are flaws in the process used by the Medical Review Contractor, which warrants reconsideration of the OIG\\'s audit process, claim denials, and conclusions made in the Draft Report. B. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s Denials Are Inconsistent with the Law and Guidance Concerning the Medicare Hospice Benefit. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s determinations regarding the terminal status of the patients at issue are inconsistent with the law governing hospice services and hospice eligibility determinations. As described below and in the attached Patient Response Summaries prepared by Dr. Leedy, the Medical Review Contractor\\'s determinations failed to follow the appropriat e standards and principles governing hospice eligibility. When applying the correct standards for eligibility under the Medicare hospice benefit, it is clear that the beneficiaries were eligible, and the level of care was appropriate. 1. The Medical Review Contractor Failed to Apply Many of the Well\\xadEstablished Hospice Principles. The Draft Report is inconsistent with many well-established hospice principles, described further below, but it is important to note at the outset that the Medical Review Contractor\\'s summaries of the records were often factually incorrect. As just one example, the Contractor denied the eligibility of a 103-year-old with a primary hospice diagnosis of atherosclerot ic heart disease, purported ly because she did not have any documented chest pain or documented pain. However, the records clearly documente d that this non-verbal patient had generalized pain and analgesics were administered to control it throughout the time period under review.20 While these errors have been addressed in the individual Patient Response Summaries, we point them out here because they call into question the validity of the entire review. 19 See AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1293; 42 C.F.R. § 418.102(b). 20 See OIG Medical Review Summary for Sample #71; see also Exhibit 28.

Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 14 The absence of decline during a single month under review is not a proper reason to conclude that a beneficiary does not have a terminal illness.21 CMS has \"also acknowledge[d] that at recertification, not all patients may show measurable decline.\"22 Based on CMS guidance, a federal district court has excluded proposed expert testimony that would have claimed that a patient must show decline to remain eligible for hospice.23 Despite this well\\xadestablished principle, the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor repeatedly denied eligibility based on the fact that the patient had not \"significantly declined.\"24 This basis for denial is contrary to the position of CMS and what the court in Vista Hospice Care identified as the appropriate interpretation of the hospice benefit. Moreover, these patients actually declined, but the Contractor still denied their eligibility because the decline was slow or not \"significant.\" For one patient, the Contractor acknowledged the patient had declined but indicated the decline was \"slow in progressing[.]\"25 For a 90-year-old patient with a primary diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma with extrasellar ell.-tension (meaning a tumor growing in the pituitary gland in the brain that has extended beyond the gland and into the surrounding tissue), the Contractor focused on a CT scan that showed the tumor had not grown, disregarding the patient\\'s nine hospitalizations, weight loss, falls, and a decline in functional abilities evidenced by a decreasing PPS score. 26 Even if decline were required, these patients did experience decline during the denied dates of service, as detailed in the Patient Response Summaries. Therefore, as a matter oflaw, claim denials based merely on the absence of decline are improper. Moreover, as a matter of fact, claim denials based on the absence of decline, when there actually was decline, are improper as well. 21 See Vista Hospice Care, No. 3:07-CV-00604-M, 2016 WL 3449833, at *16 (ND.

Patient improvement or stabilization does not disqualify a person from the hospice benefit. CMS has long recognized that apparent improvement in an individual\\' s symptoms may not mean that the individual\\'s prognosis has improved.27 Hospices treat the whole person using a multidisciplinary approach, which often results in an improvement or stabilization of symptoms. CMS has thus acknowledged that it can be difficult to distinguish a sustainable stabilization in a patient\\'s condition from the impression of stabilization that could not be maintained by the patient if discharged from hospice. This point was reaffirmed inAseraCare, discussed infra, where the court acknowledged that, because predicting life expectanc y is not an exact science, the Medicare framework recognizes that \"patients with an initial prognosis of terminality can improve over time\" without losing their right to coverage. 28 Here, however, the Medical Review Contractor improperly denied claims based on patients\\' purported improvement or stabilization.29 For example, the Contractor denied patients whose weight remained stable or had improved , failing to recognize that some of the weight gain experienced by these patients had negative prognostic implications. 30 As another example, the Contractor denied the eligibility of a 97-year-old patient with untreated stomach cancer because her pain was \"well managed\" by the hospice.31 However, the fact that the hospice was providing the patient with large doses of opioid analgesics to keep her escalating pain caused by a progressive stomach neoplasm in check does not mean her prognosis had improved. The Contractor also denied the eligibility of a 90-year-old patient who weighed only 100 pounds because she was given Marino!, an appetite stimulate , and she began to eat 100% of her meals, despite the fact that this patient\\'s primary diagnosis was cerebral atherosclerosis , the LCD for which does not require any weight loss or poor appetite.32 Even if these factors were appropriately interpreted by the Contractor to be signs of improvement of the patients\\' prognoses (which the hospice denies), it remains improper to discharge a patient until the hospice has sufficient evidence that the stabilization or improvement can be maintained. If the hospice has sufficient evidence to make that determination, it appropriat ely discharges patients with an extended prognosis, as evidenced by the records reviewed by the Contractor.33 27 70 Fed.

It is clear that the Medical Review Contractor improperly made clinical eligibility determinations using the benefit of hindsight, rather than evaluating the records from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. The applicable regulation and Medicare Benefit Policy Manual make clear that the certification of a patient\\'s eligibility for hospice must be based on the patient\\'s medical records or examination of the patient at the time of the certification. 34 Several court cases have overturned denials related to eligibility for certain Medicare benefits that \"impermissibly relied on the benefit of hindsight, which of course is always 20-20.\"35 For example, when Medicare contractors denied skilled nursing care because the records showed the patient was stable throughout the certification period, courts overturned the denials because \"[t]he services must ... be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient when the services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected to be appropriat e treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period. \"36 Further, courts have noted that Medicare beneficiaries shouldn\\'t have to risk deterioration to their health in order to validate the care they\\'re receiving.37 These same principles equally apply to hospice and are consistent with the CMS guidance .38 For many of the patients denied on the basis that they were not eligible, the Medical Review Contractor appears to have relied on the fact that certain symptoms were not documented for these patients during the month under review. For every patient denied based on eligibility, regardles s of diagnosis, the Contractor cited that the patients did not have documentation of any stage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections , or sepsis, none of which are required by any applicable LCD. Some patients actually experienced these signs or symptoms , but the Contractor did not count them because the patient responded to treatment. For example, one patient was hospitalized twice between January 2018 and April 2018 for pneumonia, but the Contractor denied his eligibility for the month of June 2018 because he did not have any documented aspiration pneumonia.39 For other patients, recurrent urinary tract infections did not count as \"frequent infections\" to support the patients\\' eligibility because, according to the Contractor, the infections responded to antibiotics.40 34 See 42 C.F.R. § 418.22(b)(3)(iii); see also, CMS, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, CMS Pub.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 38    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 17 It would have been impossible for the hospice physician to know at the time of certification, or even during portions of the month-long period under review, that the beneficiary would not experience these issues or, if they were experiencing these issues, would respond well to treatment. Moreover , even the Medical Review Contractor could only know with the improper use of hindsight that, for example, a patient ultimatel y would not experience these signs and symptoms during the month at issue or the patients\\' symptoms would resolve. Yet, the Medical Review Contractor denied the entire claim rather than define when exactly within that month the failure to experience a specific sign or symptom should result in a change to the patient\\'s prognosis.41 Furthermore , by focusing on these specific symptom s, the Contractor is not only conducting a hindsight evaluation of the records but is also ignoring other important signs and symptom s relevant to determining a patient\\'s terminal prognosis, which are described further below and in the Patient Response Summaries. Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the Contractor improperly applied a retrospective analysis to the question of each beneficiary\\'s eligibility, in direct contravention of CMS guidance and case law. Therefore, the denials must be reconsidered and redetermined without the improper use of hindsight . d. Clinical benchmark s are not required to demonstrate tenninalit y. Law and guidance has made clear that in enacting the statutory and regulatory framework governing hospice, Congress and CMS \"were careful to place the physician\\'s clinical judgment at the center of the inquiry,\" and specifically chose not to impose \"a more rigid set of criteria for eligibility determinations that would have minimized the role of clinical judgment.\"42 Indeed, the AseraCare court explained, \"CMS has considered and expressly declined to impose defined criteria that would govern the physician \\'s exercise ofjudgment. \"43 Instead, the determin ation of hospice eligibility under Medicare is \"centered on the subjective \\'clinical judgment\\' of a physician as to a patient\\'s life expectancy. ,.i4 Further, in 2008, CMS proposed a rule that would identify \"criteria\" that must be considered in certifying patients as terminall y ill,45 but subsequently removed the word \"criteria,\" however, \"in order to remove any implication that there are specific CMS clinical benchmarks in this rule that must be met in order to certify terminal illness.\\'.i6 Accordingly, it is improper to rely on specific clinical criteria to deny eligibility. 41 Additionally, this is yet another instance in which the hospice is being punished for providing good care that prevented patients from having ulcers or infections. 42 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1301. 43 Id 44 Id at 1291. 45 See Vista Hospice Care, 2016 WL 3449833, at *3. 46 See id (quoting 73 Fed.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 39    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 18 Here, contrary to AseraCare and CMS guidance, the Medical Review Contractor relied on the absence of a certain set of clinical criteria in order to deny the eligibility of beneficiarie s despite the fact that these beneficiaries showed numerous other signs and symptoms that supported their eligibility. For all of the patients denied on the basis of eligibility, the Contractor cited the purported lack of stage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections , or sepsis, regardless of the patient\\'s primary diagnosis, as if all hospice patients undoubtedly show such symptoms and the lack of such symptoms is proof the person is not eligible. Because a predetermined list of clinical benchmark s is not required to support a terminal prognosis, it was inappropriate for the Contractor to rely on the lack of those symptoms as a basis to deny the patients access to the hospice benefit. Further, using such clinical benchmarks without regard to the patient\\'s whole condition is inconsistent with clear directives from CMS.47 It also bears repeating that many of these patients had experienc ed these signs and symptoms, but the Contractor improperly ignored or downplayed them. e. LCDs are not requirements-they are \"safe harbors.\" It is well-establish ed that Local Coverage Determinations (\"LCDs\") are guidelines, \"not clinical benchmarks or mandatory requirements for hospice eligibility.\"48 Indeed, they \"are not binding and should not be considered \\'the exact criteria used for determining \\' terminal illness.\"49 Thus, \"[m ]eeting the clinical criteria in the LCDs for the patient\\'s primary diagnosis is one path to eligibility under the [Medicare Hospice Benefit], but hospices may \\'otherwise demonstrate to the [MAC] that the patient has a terminal prognosis. \"\\'50 Each of the OIG\\'s Medical Review Summaries cite to an LCD to deny the claims at issue. 51 Under applicabl e law, however, meeting an LCD is a basis to approve a claim, but failure to meet an LCD is not a basis to deny a claim. The Medical Review Summaries fail to make a critical and necessary determina tion, i.e., that the medical record for the patient at issue did not support a terminal proguosis even outside the constraints of the LCD. Accordin gly, it is improper to deny these patients\\' eligibility based on a purported failure to \"meet\" an LCD. The Medical Review Contractor \\'s determinations should be reconsider ed in light of the appropriate use of LCDs. 47 Medicare Program; FY 2015 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update; Hospice Quality Reporting Requirements and Process and Appeals for Part D Payment for Drugs for Beneficiaries Enrolled in Hospice, 79 Fed.

The Medical Review Contractor Failed to Apply the Law Consistent with the Recent AseraCare Decision. The medical review determinations referenced in the Draft Report are inconsistent with the central holdings of AseraCare,52 a landmark decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which identified the governing standards for evaluating hospice eligibility determinations. HPBC is located within the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit, andAseraCare is the governing law for HPBC and for the federal government in that jurisdiction. As noted earlier, althoughAseraCare arose under the False Claims Act, the standards set out in the decision applies to all applications of the Medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations.53 Based on a comprehensive analysis of this legal framewor~ the AseraCare court expounded upon three standards that govern any audit of hospice services, including the present one: ( 1) a \"clinical standard,\" which holds that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong; (2) a \"documentation standard,\" which requires only that the medical record support the physician \\'s clinical determination as to hospice eligibility, rather than prove the determination as a \"matter of medical fact\"; and (3) a \"competency standard,\" which permits a later reversal of certifying physicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations only if a competent reviewer (i.e., a qualified physician ) finds that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was hospice eligible. Here, the Medical Review Contractor\\'s analysis falls short of all three of these standards. a. The Clinical Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Improperly Based Its Determinations on a Reasonable Disagreement with the Hospice Physicians. In its decision, the AseraCare court made clear that \"the clinical judgment of the patient\\'s attending physician (or the provider\\'s medical director, as the case may be) lies at the center of the eligibility inquiry. \"54 The court further recognized: CMS\\'s rulemaking commentary signals that well-founded clinical judgments should be granted deference [and] .... the law is designed to give physicians meaningful latitude to make informed judgments without fear that those judgments will be second-guessed after the fact by laymen in a liability proceeding. 55 52 938 F.3d 1278 (I Ith Cir. 2019). \" See supra note 3. 54 Id at 1293. 55 Id at 1295.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 41    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 20 As the Court further explained, \"[n]othing in the statutory or regulatory framework suggests that a clinical judgment regarding a patient\\'s prognosis is invalid or illegitimate merely because an unaffiliated physician reviewing the relevant records after the fact disagrees with that clinical judgment. \"56 TheAseraCare court\\'s holding is consistent with Congress and CMS\\'s prior acknowledgment of the hospice physician\\'s central role and the complexitie s and uncertainties involved in prognostication. CMS has acknowledged that \"[i]t is the physician\\'s responsibi lity to assess the patient\\'s medical condition and determine if the patient can be certified as terminall y ill.\"57 The recognition of the hospice physician\\'s central role, both by CMS and the court in AseraCare, is consistent with other cases requiring \"extra weight\" or deference be given to a treating physician \\'s contemporaneous informed opinion unless there is a reasoned basis for declining to do so. 58 CMS has also long recognized that a terminal prognosis is far from a \"guarantee\" of death within six months, and some patients have the \"good fortune to live longer than predicted by a well-intentioned physician.\"59 \"The fact that a beneficiary lives longer than expected in itself is not cause to terminate benefits.\"60 Because prognostication is not an exact science, hospice physicians do not need to prognosticate with 100% certainty to establish a patient\\'s eligibility for hospice. Rather, CMS has stated that eligibility for hospice exists for patients whose clinical status is \"more likely than not to result in a life expectancy of six months or less. \"61 Congress confirmed this approach to hospice eligibility when it eliminated the 210-day limit on the Medicare hospice benefit. 62 TheAseraCare court also recognized that \"predicting life expectancy is not an exact science,\" and no \"certitude can be expected of physicians in the practice of treating end-of-life illness. ,\\'63 As a result, the court concluded that there are vagaries in prognostica tion that can lead to divergent, yet equally valid and supported , predictions of life expectanc y. The court did not consider it appropriate or a valid application of the Medicare hospice benefit to allow a mere difference of opinion between clinicians to result in an adverse consequence for the hospice.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 42    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 21 In other words, under AseraCare, two reasonable physicians using their clinical judgment can come to two different conclusions about a patient\\'s prognosis (and therefore hospice eligibility), and neither would be wrong. Accordingly, a later reversal of a certifying physician\\'s hospice eligibility determination is appropriate only ifno reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit. This standard gives appropriate deference to the certifying physicians, as required by the hospice legal framework and in numerous other cases. Nowhere in the Draft Report, nor in its enclosed documentation , did the OIG reference the appropriate standard described inAseraCare or even identify any standard its Contractor used for the after-the-fact evaluation of the hospice physicians \\' clinical judgment. The Medical Review Contractor does not indicate at any point in its Medical Review Summari es that no reasonable physician could have certified the patients as hospice-eligible. Rather, the Medical Review Contractor has shown, at best, that based on its post hoc review of certain records, it merely disagreed with the clinical judgment of the skilled and experienced physicians who ce1tified the patients as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients\\' circumstances and the physician s\\' best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the normal course of the patients\\' terminal illnesses. Likewise, the Medical Review Summaries do not set forth a reasoned basis for declining to give weight or deference to the certifying physicians. Under AseraCare, that is not enough to refute the hospice physicians \\' equally reasonable conclusion (reached based on the physicians\\' clinical judgment at the time they were treating the patients) that the patients had a terminal prognosis. The OIG cannot base its Draft Report only on a reasonable disagreement between the physicians who certified and recertified these patients (i.e., the physicians who actually cared for the patients and appropriately applied their clinical judgment to make eligibility determinations ) and its Medical Review Contractor who reviewed those certification s years later. The law requires more, yet the Medical Review Summaries fail to provide it. b. The Documentation Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Improperly Demanded that the Medical Record Prove, Rather than Support, a Patient\\'s Terminal Prognosis. The AseraCare court recognized that, under the plain language of the Medicare Statute and implementing regulations , \"a patient is eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit if the appropriate physician makes a clinical judgment that the patient is terminally ill in light of the patient\\'s complete medical picture, as evidenced by the patient\\'s medical records.\"65 However , the court held that the medical record supportin g the physician \\'s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment , explaining: 65 Id at 1293 (emphasis added).

(A-02-20-01001 ) 43    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 22 Importantly, none of the relevant language states that the documentary record underpinning a physician\\'s clinical judgment must prove the prognosis as a matter of medical fact. ... Nor does this framework state or imply that the patient\\'s medical records must unequivocally demonstrate to an unaffiliated physician, reviewing the records after the fact, that the patient was likely to die within six months of the time the certifying physician\\'s clinical judgment was made.66 In other words, AseraCare held that the physician \\'s clinical judgment is the \"controlling condition of reimbursement\" and supporting documentation need not, \"standing alone, prove the validity of the physician\\'s initial clinicaljudgm ent.\"67 If such were the case, the physician certification requirement would be superl1uous. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s analyses and resulting determination s do not reflect the current standard for evaluating the hospice medical record, as set forth in AseraCare. The Contractor \\'s findings that the document ation did not support patient eligibility or level of care is flawed because the Contractor cited only cherry-picked factors tending to support its denials while completel y disregarding other highly probative facts that supported the patients\\' certifications and recertifications and level of care detenninations. Identification of a few discrete facts that could only arguably support their conclusions that the patients were not terminally ill or did not require the level of care received-a point that HPBC emphatically rejects-does not satisfy the standard for evaluating documentation under AseraCare. At best, the Contractor\\'s determinations accomplish nothing more than stating that the medical record supports two divergent opinions regarding terminality, which fails to demonstrate that the patients were certified in error. By ignoring other facts in the record supportin g the certifications and recertifications, the OIG Medical Review Contractor applied a much more exacting standard in the course of its review. Accordingly, the Medical Review Summari es should be rejected. c. The Competency Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Is Not Qualified to Evaluate the Exercise of Clinical Judgment by the Experienced Hospice Physician s. FollowingAseraCar e, it is clear that the post hoc scrutiny of treating physicians\\' contemporaneous \"properly formed and sincerely held clinicaljudgment[s]\" is not enough to undermine the physicians \\' eligibility determinations . 68 Rather, a reversal of certifying physicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations is appropriate only if, based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant medical records, one can conclude that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the 66 Id at 1293-94. 67 Id at 1291, 1294. 68 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1297.

A necessary corollary of this holding (and the first two standards described above) is a requirement that the individuals conducting this post hoc review be qualified to provide \"a reasonable interpretation \" of the medical record to determine what a \"reasonable physician\" would or would not conclude. In other words, under the central principles outlined inAseraCare , only a trained hospice physician is competent to evaluate the exercise of clinical judgment by the experienced hospice physicians. Here, HPBC\\'s skilled and experienced physician s certified the patients reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients\\' circumstances and the physicians \\' best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the normal course of the patients\\' terminal illnesses. HPBC\\'s physicians\\' clinical judgment was further reviewed and affirmed by Dr. Leedy, who is Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine and a Fellow of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.69 The OIG, on the other hand, has not identified either the Medical Review Contractor or the physicians who reviewed, and ultimately disagreed with, the certifying physician s\\' contemporaneous eligibility and level of care detern1ination s, much less identified their credentials and qualifications . 70 It is concerning that the OIG has refused to provide more detail concerning the physician reviewers\\' qualifications so that its audit process is as transparent and credible as possible. Even when HPBC requested this infonnation , the OIG responded that it does not obtain the physician reviewer resumes but relies, instead, on the generic representation s made by the Medical Review Contractor during the competitiv e bidding process regarding the qualifications of the reviewers. We have included with this letter copies of our independent expert physician\\'s curriculum vitae.71 It is difficult to fathom how the OIG can find a completely anonymous reviewer more credible than the certifying physicians and Dr. Leedy, who are highly experienced in hospice and well-credentialed. Dr. Leedy\\'s Physician Statement makes clear that the qualifications of the Medical Review Contractor\\'s anonymous reviewers are in serious doubt. Numerous other providers have recently raised concern about the qualifications of the Medical Review Contractor \\'s medical reviewer.72 The OIG\\'s failure to verify the qualifications of the Contractor\\'s reviewers after 69 See Exhibit 2. 70 The end of each Medical Review Summary includes the following generic statement: The physician who reviewed this case is licensed to practice medicine, is knowledgeable in the treatment of the emollee\\'s medical condition, and is familiar with guidelines and protocols in the area of treatment under review. Additionally, the physician holds a current certification from a recognized American medical specialty board in an area appropriate to the treatment of services under review, and has no history of disciplinary action or sanctions against their license. 71 See Exhibit 2. 72 See, e.g., OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: Mission Home Health of San Diego (Aug. 2020), at page 12; OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: SuncoastHospice (May 2021), at page 22; OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: Ambercare Hospice, Inc.

It also renders the Draft Report not credible. And, under recent guidance issued to all administrative agencies, withholding information concerning the reviewers \\' qualification s is a derogation of the provider\\'s due process rights.73 In conclusion, the OIG has not demonstrated-and cannot demonstrate based on this review-that no reasonable physician would conclude that HPBC\\'s patients were eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit. The OIG\\'s conclusions , therefore, fall short of the standards required under AseraCare. 3. The Failure to Apply the Correct Legal Principle s for Hospice E ligibility is Arbitrary and Capricious. The Medical Review Contractor failed to recognize the above well-established principles, in addition to those further detailed inAseraCare, in its retrospective evaluation of the hospice physicians\\' contemporaneous determinations regarding eligibility for hospice and level of care. The determinations of the trained hospice physicians , which were made in real time-some after seeing the patient in person while conducting the face-to-face visit-are more credible and, importantly, more significant under applicable hospice law and regulations, than the review process performed by the Medical Review Contractor. To avoid an \"arbitrary and capricious\" determination , the decision must evidence that the OIG \"examined the relevant data and provided an explanation of its decision that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"74 Here, the Medical Review Contractor repetitively and rotely cited clinical criteria that are not legally mandatory and cherry\\xadpicked evidence from the medical record without a holistic consideration of each patient\\'s condition , without taking into account the hospice physicians\\' credible clinical judgments. The Contractor also failed to connect the facts and information about each patient to the determination that the documentation was insufficient. Moreover, the Contractor simply listed criteria without providing any explanation as to how that criteria relates to that particular 2021), at pages 8, 22; OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: Partners In Care, Inc.

This failure to apply the correct legal principles and connect them to the patients results in arbitrary and capricious determinations by the OIG.75 C. The Extrapolation of the Alleged Overpaym ent Here is Invalid and Inappropriate . We ask that the OIG reconsider its use of sampling and extrapolation to arrive at the estimated overpayment here for at least two reasons. First, extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication. Second, the OIG\\'s statistical methodology was fundamentally flawed, and the extrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid. 1. Extrapolation is Not Appropriate for Calculating Hospice Overpayments Given The Individuali zed Nature of Prognostication. The OIG\\'s attempted calculation of an overpayment amount through statistical sampling and extrapolation fails to take into consideration the unique nature of hospice, including each hospice patient\\'s relevant clinical profile, and the subjective and inexact nature of each hospice physician\\'s prognostication. Such an attempted calculation premised on clinical eligibility for hospice cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimated overpayment. The definitions of eligibility for hospice care are not operationally defined because of the need for subjective clinical judgments by individual physicians in the hospice context. Consequently, overpayments associated with audited services relative to hospice patients\\' life expectancy cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy to allow for extrapolation of an auditor\\'s findings across a population with sufficient confidence.76 This unique nature of hospice prognostication is supported by several cases, which have noted that extrapolation is inappropriate in the hospice contell.1-. In U.S. ex rel. Michaels v. Agape Senior Cmty., Inc., the court held that statistical sampling and extrapolation could not be used to establish liability since \"each and every claim at issue\" was \"fact-dependent and wholly unrelated to each and every other claim.\"77 The Agape court stated that extrapolation is unsuitable for circumstances where determination of medical necessity or terminal prognosis 7\\' Caring Hearts Personal Home Services, Inc. v.

While extrapolation from sampling may be appropriate where the evidence establishes that a provider\\'s objective approach was similar in all cases, making the sample a reasonable basis for extrapolation to the whole, this is not the case when it comes to determinations of terminality.82 The permissibility of statistical sampling turns on the degree to which the evidence is reliable in proving or disproving the elements of the relevant cause of action.83 Statistical sampling, therefore, cannot be used to establish an overpayment related to alleged ineligible patients, as the underlying determination of eligibility for hospice is inherently subjective, patient-specific, and dependent on the judgment of involved physicians , as discussed above. The OIG\\'s findings that certification or a certain level of care was inappropriate in one patient\\'s case should not be imputable to other claims involving-in addition to different conditions and different physicians -different caregivers, different facilities, and differen t time periods.84 Every hospice patient is entirely unique, and the hospice benefit allows patients to receive an array of services provided by a complex interdisciplina ry team, the nature of such services depending on the individual patient\\'s medical needs.85 Furthermor e, every hospice physician has a unique set of skills and experiences, and, again, courts have recognized that two physicians can disagree concerning a patient\\'s prognosis , and neither physician be wrong. 86 This 78 Id at *8.

In purporting to extrapolate from one claim, the OIG has taken one physician\\'s clinical judgment regarding one patient\\'s terminal prognosis or level of care and applied it to other physicians\\' prognostications for other patients, whose backgrounds and medical needs are each distinct from the sampled patient claim. It is impractical, if not impossible , to extrapolat e properly by accounting for all the relevant variables associated with hospice care. It is inappropriat e, therefore, to extrapolate from one physician\\'s prognostication regarding one patient to another physician\\'s conclusions about a completely different patient.87 Further, although the Act grants permission to use extrapolation in certain circumstances, it does not mandate such use in every type of audit. 88 In other words, the statute contemplates circumstances when extrapolation is neither necessary nor reasonable. In this matter, the Act should not be interpreted to permit use of extrapolation in circumstances where Congress clearly did not intend it.89 Such interpretation would also produce absurd results. If a particular application of a statute produces an absurd result, the courts should and will interpret the statute to reflect what Congress would have intended had it confronted the absurdity .90 The payment model Congress designed for hospices includes many features to ensure that hospices take responsibility for virtually all end of life care for their patients, while providing overall cost-savings to the Medicare trust.91 This responsibility and burden that Congress has imposed on hospices, and that hospices freely accept, is incompatible with the additional, draconian consequences that would result if extrapolation were pe1mitted. In particular, permitting extrapolation in this context would result in groundless overpayme nt determinatio ns that fail to acknowledge either the benefits of individualized care that hospice agencies provide beneficiaries or, more importantly , the concept that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong.92 Furthermore, the Supreme Court, as well as the Fifth Circuit have made clear that sampling and extrapolation cannot always be used to prove liability, and courts are required to engage in a particularized analysis of whether extrapolation from a particular data set can reliably prove the elements of the 87 See id at *13. 88 See § 1893(!)(3) of the Act ( 42 U.S.C. § 1395ddd(f)(3)). 89 Compare § 1879 of the Act to § 1893(!)(3) of the Act 90 The Supreme Court has consistentl y adjusted statutory commands in order to avoid absurd results.

The OIG\\'s Sampling and Extrapolation ofHPBC\\'s Claims are Statistically Invalid. HPBC engaged Dr. R. Mitchell Cox to evaluate the OIG\\'s statistical sampling and extrapolation methodology. Dr. Cox has decades of experience providing independ ent analysis of statistical sampling and extrapolation in the healthcare context.95 He has served as a statistical expert in numerous appeals of overpayment determinations before Administrative Law Judges and in federal courts. Attached as Exhibit 40 is Dr. Cox\\'s Expert Report, which identifies and explains multiple procedural and statistical concerns with respect to the OIG\\'s statistical sampling methodology and extrapolation .96 Each of the flaws detailed in Dr. Cox\\'s report demonstrates that the extrapolat ion is statistically invalid. First, the OIG failed to prove that it used a statistically valid random sample because it did not provide documentation sufficient to re-create the sampling frame or the sample. Specifically, it did not provide documentation showing that the order of claims in the frame was fixed and documented prior to sample selection. The order of claims in a sampling frame should be fixed and documented before the sample is selected to show that the sample was not improperly drawn or manipulated. The failure to fix and document the order of the claims in the sampling frame prior to sample selection means the sample does not conform to basic statistical requirements and is not statistically valid. Here, the OIG\\'s statistician did not provide documentation to support the proper ordering of the sampling frame. Specifically, the OIG failed to provide the sort order of the sampling frame and the random number seed that was used to initialize the random number generator. The former is needed to re-create the sampling frame, and the latter is needed to re-create the sample. Accordingly , it cannot be determined that the OIG drew a statistically valid random sample in this audit and extrapolation . Second, the precision and the confidence level are the two most important parameters for a statistical estimate. To have a standard precision of 10% and a two-sided 90% confidence interval, which the OIG claims it used, a sample size of 530 claims (instead of the 100 claims that the OIG reviewed) would have been required. According to the OIG\\'s own guideline s, the sample here is only 19% of the size that it should have been, and the precision is 23.38% (more than double the standard precision of 10%). Even if an overpaym ent exists, which HPBC denies, this inadequate sample size may mean that HPBC is being asked to significantly over-reimburs e 93 Vista Hospice Care at *13 (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338,367; In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 109 F.3d 1016, 1017 (5th Cir. 1997)). 94 See, generally, supra notes 72-73. 9i Exhibit 41, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Cox. 96 Exhibit 40, Statistical Expert Report of Dr. Cox. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 50    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 29 the government 133.8% more than it would have had to reimburse if the precision had been 10%, which, again, would have required a sample size of 530 claims. Third, the reason the OIG\\'s sample is too small to yield an acceptable value for the precision is that the OIG sampled by claim and not by beneficiary or episode of care, and claims belonging to the same beneficiary and episode of care are not statistically independent. The OIG\\'s sample size determination procedure fails because its sampling units -claims -are not statistically independent where there are multiple claims belonging to the same beneficiary or episode of care. In this case, a sizable fraction of the beneficiarie s and episodes of care in the OIG\\'s sampling frame had multiple claims, so a sizable fraction of the claims in the OIG\\'s sampling frame cannot be assumed to be statistically independent. The OIG\\'s sampling procedure ignored this fact, resulting in a sample too small to achieve an acceptable value of the precision and possibly resulting in the OIG asking Trustbridge to reimburse much more than it otherwise would. Fourth, the OIG violated statistical principles when it improperly removed potential underpayments from its sampling frame and thereby introduced a bias towards overpayments into its sampling frame and into its sample. In the OIG\\'s sampling plan, the OIG states that zero\\xadpaid claims (potential underpayments) were excluded from the universe. Since the zero-paid claims were excluded from the universe, they were not available to be selected for the sample here and thus did not factor into the extrapolated overpayment. Statistical principles require the inclusion of zero-paid claims in the universe. This exclusion of unpaid and potentially underpaid claims puts HPBC at an extreme disadvantage because it likely resulted in an improperly inflated extrapolated amount that the OIG has deemed an overpayment. There is absolutely no legal, administrative, or statistical justification for the OIG to have removed the zero-paid claims from the universe. Finally, the extrapolation is unfounded because the payment error rate derived from the OIG\\'s review is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolation. The OIG stated in its draft report that \"CMS, acting through a MAC [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or other contractor, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures.\" The policies and procedures followed by CMS include the MPIM. While HPBC realizes that the OIG is not a Medicare contractor and, accordingly, maintains that it is not bound by the MPIM, the MPIM is a reliable recitation of established statistical principles . Of course, any recoupment amount extrapolated from a sample, including the current one, must ultimately comply with the requirements of the MPIM to be enforceable . Under section 1893([)(3) of the Act, extrapolation is only permitted if the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines there is a \"sustained or high level of payment error.\" Under the MPIM, § 8.4.1.4, a finding of\"sustained or high level of payment error\" cannot be based upon a post-payment review error rate unless the error rate is greater than HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 51    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 30 50%. From the audit of HPBC by the OIG, the financial error rate (the total dollar amount allegedly paid in error divided by the total dollar amount paid for all claims in the sample) is 0.37 or 37%. Therefore, HPBC\\'s overpayment did not meet the minimum high error rate standard of 50% set out in the MPIM, and the MAC tasked with determinin g whether an overpayment exists will not be permitted to extrapolate. Any one of Conclusions 1 through 5 stands either on its own or in combination with the other conclusions to invalidate the OIG\\'s overpayment estimate. In Dr. Cox\\'s professional opinion, the OIG\\'s Sampling Plan is not an adequate foundation for statistical sampling for overpayment estimation . Therefore, the OIG\\'s estimate for the population is not supportab le under the OIG regulations , Medicare guidelines, and generally accepted statistical principles. 3. The SIA-Related Ovemayments Identified by the OIG Cannot Form Basis of Extrapolation Because the total service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified through a case-by-case review, the SIA overpayments identified by the OIG with respect to three sampled claims cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated SIA overpayment amount. The OIG detenuined that the HPBC received $335.57 in improper SIA payments for sampled claims 63, 70, and 100. Upon investigation, the HPBC found that the root cause of the SIA overpayments was both a Palmetto system error, as well as a technological i ssue within its electronic medical record (\"EMR\") system that inadvertently over-reporte d certain SIA-eligible units on the claims. HPBC is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA overpayment amount for each claim. Once it has completed this quantification, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Medicare the total SIA overpayment amount for all claims impacted by these issues. Because the total SIA overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified manually and repaid accurately without the use of statistical sampling, the OIG is not permitted to use sampling to extrapolate a total estimated SIA overpayment amount. Statistical sampling may be used to estimate overpayme nts \"when claims are voluminous ... and when a case-by-case review is not administratively feasible. \"97 The justification for and constitutional soundness of statistical sampling rests on it being \"the only feasible method available\" for the government to determine overpayments in some cases.98 Courts have refused, however, to allow statistical sampling when 97 HCFA Ruling No. 86-1 (emphasis added); see also ChavesCnty. Home Health Serv., Inc. v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 914, 919 (D.C.

Accordingly, the OIG should remove from its $42,336,162 estimated overpayme nt the amount that was based on a legally impermissible extrapolation of the $335.57 in SIA overpayments identified in the three sampled claims. D. Liability for the OIG\\'s Overpayment Determination Must Be Waived Under Sections 1879 and 1870 of the Act. Sections 1879 and 1870 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayment amounts even if the patients at issue were not terminally ill. The Hospice met the requirements for those waivers. Under the Caring Hearts case, the federal Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit described Section 1879 as follows: In seeming recognition of the complexity of the Medicare maze, Congress [in Section 1879] indicated that providers who didn\\'t know and couldn\\'t have reasonably been expected to know that their services weren\\'t permissible when rendered generally don\\'t have to repay the amounts they received from CMS. A sort of good faith affirmative defense, if you wilI.100 Under Caring Hearts, CMS must forgive \"mistakes\" of the provider if the provider\\'s purported mistakes were reasonable and supported the propriety of the services provided. Moreover, section 1879(g)(2) expressly includes mistakes related to determination that a hospice patient is not terminall y ill. Congress specifically added Section 1879(g)(2) to expand this waiver to determinations that a patient is not terminally ill as a means of providing some financial protection for hospices, since hospices must assume a significant financial burden for their patients based on an inherently imprecise clinical judgment regarding whether a patient\\'s terminal illness will follow the nonnal course.101 Similarly, waiver of liability is required under Section 1870 if a provider is \"without fault\" because it \"had a reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was c01Tect .... \"102 To be 99 See, e.g. US. ex rel.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 53    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 32 \"without fault,\" the provider is only required to have been reasonable, i.e., that it had a reasonable basis for its assumption regarding payment. Here, HPBC understandably relied on the reasonable clinical judgment of the patients\\' skilled physicians and had a \"reasonable basis for assuming the payment[ s] [were] correct. \"103 The Patient Response Summaries demonstrate this reasonable basis. The Medical Review Contractor has failed to show that HPBC should have known that its physicians\\' certification would be deemed in error years later or that the physicians\\' certifications or level of care determinations were unreasonable. When viewed in light of the correct standard for evaluating hospice eligibility, HPBC did not and could not reasonably have known or been expected to know that any of the patients under review would be determined years later to not be terminally ill. After all, \"physicians applying their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s projected life expectancy could disagree, and neither physician [] be wrong. \"104 For these reasons, HPBC requests that the OIG address and evaluate waiver under Sections 1879 or 1870 before issuing its final report. E. The OIG Must Include an Offset Based Upon Amounts Otherwise Payable by Medicare. The alleged overpayment identified by the OIG fails to incorporate an adjustment based upon the amounts Medicare would have otherwise paid for these beneficiaries had they not been terminally ill and elected hospice. Such an adjustment is required by long-standing secondary payer and CMS policies105 and dictated by administrative law decisions and subsequent CMS guidance confirming Medicare liability for paying an unbundled rate for services when the basis for denying a bundled payment rate is the location where the services were provided.106 Congress has confirmed that, absent hospice care, the government is otherwise required to pay for \"whatever palliative services are needed to manage [the patient\\'s] terminal illness,\" such as durable medical equipment, pharmacy, radiology , labs, and therapies.107 Any alleged overpayment must be adjusted to reflect those amounts paid for services that would otherwise 10, Id 104 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1296.; see also Vista Hospice Care, Inc., 2016 WL 3449833, at *l 7. 105 See Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual (\"MPDBM \"), CMS Pub. 100-18, Ch. 14 § 50.144. CMS has applied this reconciliation policy to hospices, indicating hospices \"are entitled to seek compensation from the Part D sponsor. ... \" See Memorandum from Tracey McCutch eon, Acting Director, Medicare Drug Benefit and C & D Data Grp., to All PartD Plan Sponsors & Medicare Hospice Providers (Mar. 10, 2014). Further, under Medicare secondary payer rules, the primary payer \"shall reimburse the [secondary payer] for any payment... with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" Act§ 1862(b)(2)(B)(ii). 106 See CMS, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (\"MBPM \"), Pub No., 100-02, Ch. 6 § 10-10.1 (\"[p]ayment may be made under Part B for physician services and for [certain] nonphysician medical and other health services ... when furnished by a participatin g hospital ( either directly or under arrangements) to an inpatient of the hospital, but only if payment for these services cannot be made under Part A\" when the \"inpatient admission was not reasonable and necessary, ... and if waiver of liability payment [was] not made\").

III. Response to Recommendations in the OIG\\'s Draft Report There are three recommendations in the Draft Report: (1) refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. HPBC\\'s position with respect to these recommendations is set forth below. A. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of The Alleged Improper Payments Within the 4-year Claim Reopening Period. HPBC has already voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims with an SIA overpayment (Sample #63 and 100) and is in the process of identifying and voluntarily refunding other SIA overpayments that were the result of a Palmetto system error and EMR system error, including the SIA payment for Sample #70.108 HPBC does not concur with this recommendation with respect to all other claims denied by the Medical Review Contractor.109 HPBC and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the OIG and have determined that HPBC did not receive an overpayment and that the Medical Review Contractor\\'s claim denials and the OIG\\'s statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law with respect to these other claims. The rationale for HPBC\\'s determinati ons is set fo1th in this letter and the Patient Response Summaries prepared by its independent expert physician, Dr. Leedy. If any attempt is made by HPBC\\'s MAC to recoup funds related to the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC intends to exercise all appeal rights available to it. B. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of Other Overpaymen ts in Accordance with 60-Day Repayment Rule. HPBC acknowledges its obligations under the 60-Day Repayment Rule. As noted above, HPBC has voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims and will be making further voluntary repayments associate d with SIA overpayments currently being investigated. However, besides claims involving SIA payments, HPBC has determined that no other repayments under this rule are warranted at this time. The Draft Report indicates that the OIG believes its report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments, and, therefore, HPBC must \"exercise reasonabl e diligence to identify overpayments\" for a 6-year lookback period pursuant to the requirements of the 60-day rule in§ 1128J(d) of the Act and 42 C.F.R. § 401.305 applies. As 108 On April 8, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Palmetto for service intensity add-on payments received from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. This refund included a repayment of SIA payments for two individuals included in the OIG sample (Samples 63 and 100). 109 This includes all 37 claims denied on the basis of eligibility or level of care. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 55     BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 34 noted above, HPBC and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the OIG and have determined that it did not receive any other overpayments and that the OIG\\'s claim denials and statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law. Accordingly , HPBC has met the obligations of§ 1128J( d) of the Act and 42 C.F .R. § 401.305 as set out by CMS in 81 Fed. Reg. 7654 (Feb. 12, 2016). C. Response to OIG Recommendation to Strengthen its Policies and Procedures. HPBC does not concur with this recommendation. As already discussed, HPBC has robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance program, which are shown by a number of CMS data sets to be effective. HPBC\\'s policies and procedures comply with and incorporate the Medicare requirements. While HPBC routinely and proactively takes steps to strengthen its practices to ensure compliance with the everchanging Medicare requirements , it disagrees that any particular flaws exist in its current policies and procedures that allowed ineligible patients to be certified for hospice or allowed provision of unnecessary GIP or CHC care. Moreover, the Draft Report does not identify any particular flaws. To be sure, HPBC has confirmed through an independent expert physician that its claims were appropriate. As noted throughout, the Draft Report is significantly flawed and is indicative of an overzealous, inexperienced Medical Review Contractor. CONCLUSION Thank you once again for the opportunity to present these comments to the Draft Report. We appreciate the work that the OIG has put into this effort, and we respectfully request that the OIG consider these comments in reviewing and revising the Draft Report.

This statutory mission is carried out through a nationwide network of audits, investigations, and inspections conducted by the following operating components: Office of Audit Services The Office of Audit Services (OAS) provides auditing services for HHS, either by conducting audits with its own audit resources or by overseeing audit work done by others.  Audits examine the performance of HHS programs and/or its grantees and contractors in carrying out their respective responsibilities and are intended to provide independent assessments of HHS programs and operations.  These audit s help reduce waste, abuse, and mismanagement and promote economy and efficiency throughout HHS. Office of Evaluation and Inspections The Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI) conducts national evaluations to provide HHS, Congress, and the public with timely, useful, and reliable information on significant issues.  These evaluations focus on preventing fraud, waste, or abuse and promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of departmental programs.  To promote impact, OEI reports also present practical recommendations for improving program operations. Office of Investigations The Office of Investigations (OI) conducts criminal, civil, and administrative investigations of fraud and misconduct related to HHS programs, operations, and beneficiaries.  With investigators working in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, OI util izes its resources by actively coordinating with the Department of Justice and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities.  The investigative efforts of OI often lead to criminal convictions, administrative sanctions, and/or civil monetary penalties. Office of Counsel to the Inspector General The Office of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) provides general legal services to OIG, rendering advice and opinions on HHS programs and operations and providing all lega l support for OIG’s internal operations.  OCIG represents OIG in all civil and administrative fraud and abuse cases involving HHS programs, including False Claims Act, program exclusion, and civil monetary penalty cases.  In connection with these cases, OC IG also negotiates and monitors corporate integrity agreements.  OCIG renders advisory opinions, issues compliance program guidance, publishes fraud alerts, and provides other guidance to the health care industry concerning the anti- kickback statute and ot her OIG enforcement authorities.

Previous OIG reviews found that Medicare inappropriately paid for hospice services that did not meet certain Medicare requirements. Our objective was to determine whether hospice services provided by Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. (HPBC ), complied with Medicare requirements. How OIG Did This Audit Our audit covered 37,121 claims for which HPBC (located in Palm Beach, Florida) received Medicare reimbursement of $149 million for hospice services provided from April 2017 through March 2019. We reviewed a random sample of 100 claims . We evaluated compliance with selected Medicare billing requirements and submitted these sampled claims and the associated medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, medical necessity, and coding requirements . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit : Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. What OIG Found HPBC received Medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements . Of the 100 hospice claims in our sample , 60 claims complied with Medicare requirement. However, the remaining 40 did not comply with the requirements. Specifically , the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal illness prognosis (30 claims) , the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed (9 claims) , and services were not supported in the medical record (3 claims) . The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. Improper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies and procedures were not effective in ensuring the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, the appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC received at least $ 42.3 million in improper Medicare reimbursement for hospice services . What OIG Recommends and HPBC Comments We recommend that HPBC: (1) refund to the Federal Government the portion of the estimated $42.3 million in Medicare overpayments that are within the 4 -year reopening period; (2) based upon the results o f this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return overpayments, in accordance with the 60 -day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. In written comments on our draft report, HPBC disagreed with our findings and recommendations.  Specifically, HPBC disagreed with all but 3 of the 40 sample claims questioned in our report. HBPC asserted that our conclusions were inaccurate or divergent from the clinical facts present in the medical records . HPBC also engaged a statistical expert who challenged the validity of our statistical sampling methodology and the resulting extrapolation. After reviewing HPBC’s comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We also reviewed HPBC’s statistical expert’s comments and maintain that our statistical methodology and extrapolation are statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC.

Previous Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits and eval uations found that Medicare inappropriately paid for hospice services that did not meet certain Medicare requirements.1 OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine whether hospice services provided by Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc. (HPBC ), complied with Medicare requirements. BACKGROUND The Medicare Program Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) established the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage to people aged 65 and over, people with disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare program. Medicare Part A, also known as hospital insurance, provides for the coverage of various types of services, including hospice services.2 CMS contracts with Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to pro cess and pay Medicare hospice claims in four home health and hospice jurisdictions . The Medicare Hospice Benefit To be eligible to elect Medicare hospice care, a beneficiary must be entitled to Medicare Part A and certified by a physician as being terminally ill (i.e., as having a medical prognosis with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the illness runs its normal course) .3 Hospice care is palliative (supportive), rather than curative, and includes, among other thing s, nursing care, medical social services, hospice aide services, medical supplies, and physician services. The Medicare hospice benefit has four levels of care: (1) routine home care, (2) general inpatient (GIP) care , 1 See Appendix B for a list of related OIG reports on Medicare hospice services. 2 The Act §§ 1812(a)(4) and (5). 3 The Act §§ 1814(a)(7)(A) and 1861(dd)(3)(A) and 42 CFR §§ 418.20 and 418.3. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 1                                                                                                                                                      (3)inpatient respite care, and (4) continuous home care (CHC) .  Medicare provides an all-inclusive daily payment based upon the level of care .4 Beneficiaries eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit may elect hospice care by filing a signed election statement with a hospice.5 Upon election, the hospice assumes the responsibility for medical care of the beneficiary’s terminal illness , and the beneficiary waives all rights to Medicare payment for services that are related to the treatment of the terminal condition or related conditions for the duration of the election, except for services provided by the designated hospice directly or under arra ngements or services of the beneficiary’s attending physician if the physician is not employed by or receiving compensation from the designated hospice .6 The hospice must submit a notice of election (NOE) to its MAC within 5 calendar days after the effective date of election.  If the hospice does not submit the NOE to its MAC within the required timeframe, Medicare will not cover and pay for days of hospice care from the effective date of election to the date that the NOE was submitted to the MAC .7 Beneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods.8 At the start of the initial 90 -day benefit period of care, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s terminal illness from the hospice medical director or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group9 and the beneficiary’s attending physician, if any. For s ubsequent benefit periods, a written certification by only the hospice medical director or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group is required.10 The initial certification and all subsequent recertifications must include a brief narrative explanation of the clinical find ings that supports a life expectancy 4 42 CFR § 418.302.  For dates of service on or after January 1, 2016, there are two daily payment rates for routine home care – a higher rate for the first 60 days and a lower rate for days 61 and beyond. 80 Fed.

The physician or nurse practitioner conducting the face -to-face encounter must gather and document clinical finding s to support a life expectancy of 6 months or less.13 Effective for dates of service beginning January 1, 2016, hospices can claim a service intensity add-on (SIA) payment for direct patient care provided by a registered nurse and/or a social worker to a beneficiary receiving routine home care during the last 7 days of life.14 Hospice providers must establish and maintain a clinical record for each hospice patient .15 The record must include all services, whether furnished directly or under arrangements made by the hospice . Clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis of a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course must be filed in the medical record with the written certification of ter minal illness .16 Medicare Requirements To Identify and Return Overpayments OIG believes that this audit report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments. Upon receiving credible information of potential overpayments, providers must exercise reasonable diligence to identify overpayments (i.e., determine receipt of and quantify any overpayments) during a 6 -year lookback period. Providers must report and return any identified overpayments by the later of (1) 60 days after identifying those overpayments or (2) the date that any corresponding cost report is due (if applicable).  This is known as the 60-day rule.17 The 6 -year lookback period is not limited by OIG’s audit period or restrictions on the Government’s ability to reopen claims or co st reports.

HPBC is a not -for-profit hospice provider located in West Palm Beach, Florida.19 From April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019 (audit period) , HPBC provided hospice services to 12,762 beneficiaries and received Medicare reimbursement of almost $150 million .20 Palmetto GBA , LLC (Palmetto) serves as the MAC for HPBC . HOW WE CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT Our audit covered 37, 121 claims totaling $149,850,136.21 We reviewed a random sample of 100 of these claims , totaling $ 402,424, to determine whether hospice services complied with Medicare requirements . Specifically, we evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements and submitted the se sampled claims and the associated medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, medical necessity, and coding requirements . We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditi ng standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our find ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our find ings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix A contains the de scribes our audit scope and methodology, Appendix C describes our statistical sampling methodology, and Appendix D contains our sample results and estimates . 18 42 CFR §§ 401.305(d), 405.980(c)(4), and 413.24(f); CMS’ Provider Reimbursement Manual, Pub. 15 -1-Part 1 , § 2931.2; and 81 Fed. Reg. at 7670. 19 HPBC is one of three hospices operated by Trustbridge , a nonprofit organization that offers hospice and palliative services throughout Florida’s Broward and Palm Beach counties. 20 Claims data for the period April 1, 2017, through March 31, 2019, was the most current data available when we started our audit. 21 In developing this sampling frame, we included hospice claims for which a payment was made from the Medicare Trust Fund and claims that were not identified in the Recovery Audit Contractor data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 4                                                                                                                                                               FINDING S HPBC received Medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements. Of the 100 hospice claims in our sample, 6 0 claims complied with requirements, but 40 did not. Specifically: • For 30 claims, the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal prognosis. • For nine claims, the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed for Medicare reimbursement. • For three claims, the medical record did not support services claimed for SIA payment s.22 Improper payment of these claims occurred because HPBC’s policies and procedures were not effective in ensur ing the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, t he appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42.3 million in improper Medicare reimbursement for hospice services.23 As of the publication of this report, this unallowable amount includes claims outside the 4 -year reopening period .24 Notwithstanding, HPBC can request that a Medicare contractor reopen the initial determinations for those claims for the purpose of reporting and returning overpayments under the 60 -day rule without being limited by the 4 -year reopening period .25 TERMINAL PROGNOSIS NOT SUPPORTED To be eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit, a beneficiary must be c ertified as being terminally ill. Beneficiaries are entitled to receive hospice care for two 90 -day benefit periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60 -day benefit periods. At the start of the initial 90 -day benefit period of care, the hospice must obtain written certification of the beneficiary’s terminal illness from the hospice medical director or the phy sician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group and the individual’s attending physician, if any. For subsequent benefit periods, a written certification from the hospice medical director or the physician member of 22 The total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. 23 Specifically, we estimated that HPBC received at least $42,336,162 in overpayments. To be conservative, we recommend recovery of overpayments at the lower limit of a two -sided 90- percent confidence interval.  Lower limits calculated in this manner are designed to be less than the actual overpayment total 95 percent of the time. 24 42 CFR § 405.980(b)(2) (permitting a contractor to reopen within 4 years for good cause) and 42 CFR § 405.980(c)(2) (permitting a party to request that a contractor reopen within 4 years for g ood cause). 25 42 CFR § 405.980(c)(4). Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

Clinical information and other documentation that supports the beneficiary’s terminal prognosis must accompany the physician’s certification and be filed in the medical record with the written certification of terminal illness.26 For 30 of the 100 sample claims, the clinical record provided by HPBC did not support the associated beneficiary’s terminal prognosis . Specifically, the in dependent medical review contractor determined that the records for these claims did not contain sufficient clinical information and other documentation to support the medical prognosis of a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness r an its normal course. LEVEL OF CARE NOT SUPPORTED Medicare reimbursement for hospice services is made at predetermined payment rates —based on the level of care provided —for each day that a beneficiary is under the hospice’s care.  The four levels are: (1) routine home , (2) GIP care, (3) inpatient respite care, and (4) CHC. 27 GIP care is provided in an inpatient facility for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that cannot be managed in other settings, such as the beneficiary’s home, and is intended to be short- term.28 Routine home care is the least expensive level of hospi ce care, followed by inpatient respite care, GIP care, and CHC which is the most expensive level of hospice care. For nine claims in o ur sample , the associated beneficiary’s clinical record did not support the need for the claimed level of care. Specifically, the associated beneficiaries’ hospice care needs could have been met if HPBC had provided services at the less expensive routine level of c are.29 SERVICES NOT SUPPORTED Effective for hospice services with dates of beginning January 1, 2016, hospices can claim an SIA payment for direct patient care provided by a registered nurse and/or a social worker to a beneficiary receiving routine home care during the last 7 days of life.30 The SIA payment is in 26 42 CFR §§ 418.22(b)(2) and 418.104(a). 27 Definitions and payment procedures for specific level -of-care categories are codified at 42 CFR § 418.302. For dates of service on or after January 1, 2016, there are two daily payment rates for routine home care – a higher rate for the first 60 days and a lower rate for days 61 and beyond.  80 Fed. Reg. 47142, 47172 (Aug. 6, 2015). 28 42 CFR §§ 418.302(b)(4) and 418.202(e). 29 For seven of the nine claims, we used the applicable payment rates and questioned the difference in payment amounts between the claimed level of care and routine levels of care.  For two other claims, we questioned the entire amount because the claims had more than one deficiency. For these claims, the terminal prognosis was not supported. 30 42 CFR § 418.302(b)(1).

A minimum of 15 minutes (1 unit) of nursing and/or social worker services must be provided to receive the SIA payment . 31 For three sample claims, HPBC received SIA payments for which it was not eligible . Specifically, HPBC was not eligible for SIA payments associated with 47 units that were not documented in the associated beneficiary’s medical file. RECOMMENDATION S We recommend that Hospice of Palm Beach County , Inc.: • refund to the Federal Government the portion of the estimated $42,336,162 for hospice services that did not comply with Medicare requirements and that are within the 4-year claims reopening period;32 • based upon the results of this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60 -day rule33 and identify any of those returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendat ion; and • strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements . HPBC COMMENTS AND OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL RESPONSE In written comments on our draft report, HPBC , through its attorney, disagreed with our recommendations and disagreed with most of our findings. Specifically, HPBC disagreed with 31 80 Fed. Reg. 47142, 47175 (Aug. 6, 2015). See also, CMS’s Medicare Claims Processing Manual , Pub. 100- 04, chapter 11, § 30.2.2. 32 OIG audit recommendations do not represent final determinations by Medicare.  CMS, acting through a MAC or other co ntracto r, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures.  Providers have the right to appeal those determinations and should familiarize themselves with the rules pertaining to when o verpaym ents must be returned or are subject to offset while an appeal is pending.  The Medicare Part A and Part B appeals process has five levels (42 CFR § 405.904(a)(2)), and if a provider exercises its right to an appeal, the provider does not need to return overpayments until after the second level of appeal.  Potential overpayments identified in OIG reports that are based on extrapolation may be re -estimated depending on CMS determinations and the outcome of appeals. 33 This recommendation does not apply to any overpayments that are both within our sampling frame (i.e., the population from which we selected our statistical sample) and refunded based upon the extrapolated overpayment amount.  Those overpayments are already covered in the previous recommendation. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 7                                                                                                                                                                                   all but 3 of the 40 sample claims questioned in our draft report.34 Although HPBC acknowledged its obligations under the 60 -day rule, it reviewed our audit findings and did not agree that a dditional refunds pursuant to the rule were warranted at this time .  HPBC also did not agree with our recommendation to strengthen its policies and procedures because it believes it has robust policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements.  However, HPBC did state that it will continue to routinely review and update its policies to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws. HPBC asserted that OIG’s audit is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects and, as a result, OIG’s overpayment determinations are invalid . Specifically, HPBC believed that the clinical documentation it submitted for the sample claims met Medicare requirements and that OIG’s medical review contractor’s denials were inconsistent with hospice regulations and guidance. HPBC contended that the medical review contr actor ignored patients’ overall medical condition, focused on irrelevant points, and “cherry -picked” information that resulted in misleading, incomplete, and inaccurate conclusions. HPBC further argued that statistical extrapolation was an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of hospice services because of the individualized nature of each patient’s clinical profile and the subjective and inexact nature of a physician’s level of care determinations (prognostication).  HPBC engaged a statistical expert, who evaluated OIG’s sampling and extrapolation methodologies, and claimed in a report that, even if extrapolation was appropriate, OIG’s sampling and extrapolation were not statistically valid. Lastly , HPBC stated that the SIA related overpayments found in our sample cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated overpayment amount. HPBC also contended that sections 1870 and 1879 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayments, even if the associated beneficiaries were not terminally ill, as long as the provider has a reasonable basis for assuming the claims it submitted were correct.  Accordingly, HPBC stated that the overpayments identified by OIG should be waived because HPBC relied on the clinical judgments of the benefi ciaries’ certifying physicians; therefore, HPBC had a reasonable basis to believe the Medicare payments were correct. HPBC also stated that OIG’s overpayment must be reduced to offset amounts for items and services (e.g., durable medical equipment, phar maceuticals, and supplies ) that would otherwise be payable by Medicare had the beneficiary not elected hospice. We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We also reviewed the report prepared by HPBC ’s statistical expert and maintain that our sampling methodology and extrapolation were statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by Medicare to HPBC . However, we note that OIG audit 34 Accordingly, HPBC does not believe it was overpaid for hospice services except for three claims for which it agreed that it received excess SIA payments in error.  HPBC state d that it can quantify and will refund all SIA-related overpayments in the sampl ing frame; therefore, they state these claims cannot be included in the projected disallowance.

The action official —in this case, CMS— may reexamine claims that we have recommended disallowing and determine whether an overpayment exists and if the waiver provisions cited by HPBC apply. Lastly, we did not reduce the overpayments we identified by amounts for services that HPBC stated would otherwise be payable by Medicare because we have no assur ance that Medicare would cover these services. A summary of HPBC ’s comments and our responses follows. HPBC ’s comments are included as Appendix E.35 MEDICARE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION HPBC Comments HPBC engaged an independent physician to analyze OIG’s m edical review contractor’s findings and conclusions .  According to HPBC, t he physician confirmed that the certifications of terminal illness and levels of care for beneficiaries associated with our sa mple claims were supported by medical records. Specifically, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor’s analyses were not supported by the medical records, contained factual errors, and failed to apply fundamental principles or cite relevant medical literature.  Further, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor used similar boilerplate language in its determination letters, which HPBC asserted was an indication of the contractor’s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and to thoroughly review the associated medical records. HPBC also claimed that the medical review contractor “ cherry -picked ” discrete bits of information to support its decisions while disregarding other facts in the record that supported the beneficiaries’ terminal prognosis. Lastly, HPBC argued that the medical review process was flawed because it only included a review of 1 month of records (or less) for each hospice patient, which does not provide a complete medical picture of a beneficiary’s condition. Office of Inspector General Response We maintain that the clinical records submitted by HPBC for the sample claims questioned in our draft report did not meet Medicare requirements. Despite using boilerplate language, t he independent medical review contractor properly used the appropriate statutory and regulatory hospice criteria, including applicable Local Coverage Determination (LCD) guidelines, as the framework for its determinations.  Specifically, the medical review contractor applied standards set out in 42 C FR § 418.22(b)(2), which require clinical information and other documentation that support the medical prognosis to accompany the certification and be filed in the med ical 35 HPBC included multiple exhibits as part of its comments.  These exhibits includ ed a statement by the physician engaged by the hospice, the engaged physician’s curricula vitae, a claim -by-claim rebuttal of the findings in our draft report, its statistical expert’s report on our sampling methodology , and the statistical expert’s curricula vitae. Although the exhibits are not included as appendices in our final report, we considered the entirety of these documents in preparing our final report and will provide HPBC’s comments in their entirety to CMS. Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 9                                                                                                                                                                    record. The contractor did not cite medical literature because it audited to Medicare requirements and medical literature is not considered a Medicare requirement . Further, contrary to HPBC’s assertion , the medical review contractor did not review o nly 1 month ’s worth of records (or less) for each hospice patient or “cherry -pick” information .  Rather, the contractor evaluated the entire medical record provided by the hospice for each sample claim to determine whether Medicare requirements were met. This included, but was not limited to, hospice election records; the initial certification of terminal illness; recertifications that covered the sample claim; plans of care ; medication records; physician, nurse, hospice aide , and social worker notes; hosp ital medical records (if applicable) ; and billing documents .  When the medical records and other available clinical factors supported the physician’s medical prognosis or the level of hospice care provided, the medical review contractor determined that Medicare requirements were met. MEDI CAL REVIEW CONTRACTOR ’S DETERMINATIONS HPBC Comments HPBC asserted th at the independent medical review contractor failed to apply many well-established hospice principles and the appropriate standards governing hospice eligibility. Specifically, HPBC stated that it was improper for the medical review contractor to deny a claim solely on the basis that there was no decline in the beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement. HPBC further alleged that t he cont ractor’s determination s were made using the benefit of hindsight and not on the information known at the time the care was provided.  In addition, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor denied hospice benefits because the contractor relied on a predetermined list of clinical benchmarks that are not required to support a terminal prognosis.  Further, HPBC claimed that the medical review contactor relied on LCDs to determine whether a beneficiary met hospice eligibility requirements and that it improperly denied a claim when the ben eficiary’s condition did not meet an LCD. As examples, HPBC described four sample claims (numbers 8, 9, 72, and 78) for which it believed the associated beneficiaries’ certifications of terminal illness and levels of care were supported by medical records but were considered unallowable by the independent medical review contractor.36 Lastly, HPBC stated that the medical review contractor failed to apply the law consistent with the 2019 Unite d States v. AseraCare , Inc. decision.37 According to HPBC, AseraCare states that “a certifying hospice physician’s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit” and that “medical record supporting a physician’s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment.” 36 In exhibits attached to its comme nts, HPBC included what it described as “Patient Response Summaries” rebutting the claims denied or partially denied by the independent medical review contractor. 37 938 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2019). Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 10                                                                                                                                                                  Office of Inspector General Response We disagree with HPBC’s assertions that the independent medical review contractor failed to apply appropriate Medicare hospice requirements (i.e., laws and regulations) when conducting its review and that its determinations of terminal status were inconsis tent with hospice coverage requirements. As previously mentioned, the medical review contractor appropriately applied the standards set out in 42 CFR § 418.22(b)(2) to determine whether terminal prognosis was supported.  In those determinations, the contr actor considered the certifying physician’s terminal diagnosis, as well the medical records provided by the hospice for each sample claim, guided by questions rooted in the Medicare requirements and the clinical knowledge of a licensed physician who specializes in hospice and palliative medicine and is familiar with Medicare hospice guidelines and protocols. The medical review contractor did not deny a claim because there was no decline in the associated beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement. Rather, it evaluated all clinical conditions presented in the medical records collectively to obtain an overall clinical picture of the beneficiary and, based on the information that was available and known at the time of certification or recertification, determined whether hospice eligibility requirements were met .  We acknowledge that hospice care may still be appropriate for some beneficiaries who did not meet guidelines detailed in LCDs, based upon an individual assessment of the beneficiaries’ health status.  Accordingly, the independent medical review contactor merely used LCD guidelines as a tool to evaluate terminal prognosis.  Finally, it was the opinion of OIG’s medical reviewer contractor that the documentation in the m edical records did not always support the terminal prognosis. Regarding the four sample claims that HPBC described in its comments as incorrectly determined to be unallowable, we note that the independent medical review contractor determined that the associated medical records did not support the terminal prognosis or the need for the level of hospice care provided. Therefore, we mai ntain that the medical review contractor consistently and appropriately applied Medicare hospice eligibility requirements. Specifically: • Sample claim number 8: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had numerous prognos es that impact ed comorbid and secondary conditions , as well as unintentional weight loss. However, the independent medical review contractor determined that there was no documentation of secondary conditions38 and that the beneficiary had gained weight since admission.  Therefore, the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported. • Sample claim number 9: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary had several comorbid and secondary conditions that contribut ed to her terminal prognosis and that she lost 10.4 percent of her body weight in under 2 months.  However, the independent 38 Such as stage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 11                                                                                                                                                                            medical review contractor determined that the beneficiary’s medical file did not document secondary conditions or ongoing weight loss. Therefore, the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported. • Sample claim number 72: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary required a higher level of care due to labored breathing and elevated heart rate in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain.  However, the medical review contractor determined that although the medical file documented that the beneficiary was imminently dying and unresponsive, the symptoms were being well controlled on scheduled subcutaneous (i.e., not intravenous) doses of morphine. The beneficiary was not in crisis ; therefore, the predominance of services provided d id not require nursing support.  As a result, the continuous home care services provided was not required . • Sample claim number 78: HPBC stated that the associated beneficiary’s unstable medical condition and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure required around -the-clock monitoring by a nurse and frequent administration of several intravenous medication s.  However, the medical review contractor determined the beneficiary’s medical condition did not warrant a short -term inpatient stay for pain control or ac ute or chronic symptom management that could not feasibly be provided in other settings. Specifically, t he medical file did not document that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered.  Rather, medication was administered subcutaneously , which does not require an inpatient setting.  Therefore, the general inpatient care services provided were not required. In addition to its exhibits , which include d a claim- by-claim rebuttal, HPBC’s comments included several examples that, according to HPBC, demonstrate that the medical review contractor improperly denied claims because beneficiaries’ conditions had not declined or their conditions had improved or st abilized .  HPBC stated that the contractor did not base the ir determinations from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. For these examples, we maintain that the medical review contractor determin ed that the associated medical f ile did not support a terminal prognosis of 6 months or less or that the level of care provided was required .  For example, for sample claim number 58, HPBC state d that the medical review contractor denied hospice eligibility for a 90 -year -old beneficiary who weighed 100 pounds but began to eat all of her meals because she was given an appetite stimulate despite having a primary diagnosis of cerebral atherosclerosis (i.e., a neurological condition) for which the LCD does not requir e any weight loss or poor appetite.  Further, the medical review contractor noted that there was no evidence of significant decline.  However, we note that the medical review contractor also determined that the there was no documentation of secondary condi tions (e.g., stage III/IV pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections, or sepsis ).  In addition, the beneficiary was alert and the documentation supported improved and healing of a stage 2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 12                                                                                                                                                             pressure ulcer. Therefore, the medical review contractor determined that the medical file did not support a prognosis of 6 months or less. We also disagree with HPBC’ s AseraCare -based assertion that the eligibility determination can be questioned only if no reasonable physician . . . could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the hospice benefit. To the contrary, in AseraCare , the Eleventh Circuit rejected the Government’s concern that, under the court’s reading of the eligibility framework, if a physician certified a patient as terminally ill, CMS would be required to reimburse the hospice provider unless CMS could determine that no other reviewer could possibly conclude the patient was terminally ill.39 Although th e AseraCare case was about the circumstances under which certifications of terminal illness could be deemed false for purposes of Federal False Claims Act liability, the Eleventh Circuit clearly acknowledged that CMS is statutorily prohibited from paying f or services that are not reasonable and necessary for the palliation or management of terminal illness and that CMS retains a well- established right to review and deny payments for claims that do not meet that standard. Accordingly, we maintain the validity of our findings . OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL SAMPLING METHODOLOGY HPBC Comments HPBC challenged the validity of our statistical sampling and extrapolation methodologies, engaged a statistical expert to review OIG’s sampling methodology, and pr ovided a copy of the statistical expert’s re port. HPBC stated that extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication. HPBC also stated that OIG’s statistical methodolo gy was fundamentally flawed and the extrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid. According to HPBC ’s statistical expert: (1) OIG did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample, (2) OIG’s sample size was too small to yield an accurate estimate of a two-sided 90 -percent confidence interval and standard precision of 10 percent, (3) the sample units w ere not statistically independent because OIG sample d by claim— not b y beneficiary or episode of care, (4) OIG improperly excluded zero -paid claims from its universe, and (5) the payment error rate is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolatio n.  Lastly, HPBC stated that the SIA payments identified as unsupported in o ur draft report were due to a Palmetto system error as well as an electronic medical record (EMR) system error. HPBC stated that it can quantify total SIA overpayment s in the sampling frame through a case -by-case review; therefore, OIG is not permitted to use sampling to estimate this amount. Office of Inspector General Response After reviewing the statistical expert’s report, we maintain that our sampling and extrapolation methodologies are statistically valid.  Federal courts have consistently upheld statistical 39 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1295 . Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 13                                                                                                                                                        sampling and extrapolation as a valid means to determine overpaymen t amounts in Medicare and Medicaid.40 The legal standard for use of sampling and extrapolation is that it must be based on a statistically valid methodology, not the most precise methodology.41 We properly executed our statistical sampling methodology i n that we defined our sampling frame and sample unit, randomly selected our sample, applied relevant criteria in evaluating the sample, and used statistical sampling software (i.e., RAT -STATS) to apply the correct formulas for the extrapolation. The stati stical lower limit that we use for our recommended recovery represents a conservative estimate of the overpayment that we would have identified if we had reviewed each and every claim in the sampling frame.  The conservative nature of our estimate is not c hanged by the nature of the errors identified in this audit. Moreover, the court cases that HPBC ’s attorney referenced in support of the proposition that extrapolation is inappropriate for individualized prognostication in hospices42 are limited to False Claims Act cases and therefore are inapplicable to OIG audit recommendations and CMS recoveries arising from OIG audits. The statistical expert’s claim that OIG did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample is not c orrect.  Following the exit conference, we provided HPBC with several workpapers, including, but not limited to, the sampling plan, sampling frame, random number seed , and selected sample items.43 Therefore, we maintain that HPBC has the information it needs to recreate the sampling frame and identify the individual sample items.44 The statistical expert’s statement that OIG’s sample was too small to yield an accurate estimate is not correct.  Small sample sizes (e.g., smaller t han 100 ) have routinely been upheld by the 40 See Yorktown Med. Lab., Inc. v. Perales , 948 F.2d 84 (2d Cir. 1991); Illinois Physicians Union v.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 14                                                                                                                                                                     Departmental Appeals Board and Federal courts.45 The legal standard for a sample size is that it must be sufficient to be statistically valid, not that it be the most precise methodology.46 Sample size is incorp orated into the computation of the confidence interval, with a smaller sample size generally resulting in a smaller lower limit. Because absolute precision is not required, any imprecision in the sample may be remedied by recommending recovery at the lowe r limit, which was done in this audit.47 This approach results in an estimate that is lower than the actual overpayment amount 95 percent of the time, and thus it generally favors the provider.48 Additionally, we disagree with HPBC statistical expert’s statement that the sample unit used for this audit is not statistically independent because OIG sampled by claim and not beneficiary. The proofs for the unbiased nature of our estimate and the conse rvative nature of the lower limit require random selection of the sample units (in this case, claims). We performed this selection using a valid random number generator.  The proofs underlying our methods do not make any assumptions about the distribution of beneficiaries in the sampling frame or in the sample.49 We also disagree that OIG violated statistical principles by excluding zero -paid claims from the universe.50 Generally, OIG may perform a statistical or non -statistical review of a provider without covering all claims from that provider.  Further, when extrapolation is used, OIG only projects to the sampling frame from which the sample was drawn.  Therefore, contrary to HPBC’ s assertion, a valid sampling frame does not need to include all zero -paid claims within the audit period. HPBC assert s that any r ecoupment amount extrapolated from a sample must ultimately comply with the requirements of the MPIM to be enforceable. However, a s HPBC acknowledges in its 45 See Anghel v.

The text provides the detailed proofs underlying design- based sampling methods for stratified and simple random sampling used by OIG. The type of independence cited by HPBC is not referenced in any of these proofs. 50 In the exhibit report , HPBC’s statistical expert relied heavily on CMS’s Medicare Program Integrity Manual (MPIM) , which does not apply to OIG (as acknowledged by the statistical expert on page 4 of the HPBC’s e xhibit). However, we note that MPIM , ch. 8, § 8.4.3.2 expressly allows for the removal of claims/claim lines attributable to sample units for which there was no payment.

Lastly, we disagree with HPBC ’s assertion that OIG is not permitted to include SIA overpayment amounts in the estimate of total improper payments because HPBC states it is able to identify all impacted claims and quantify the overpayment through a case -by-case review . The estimate presented in this report represents the total amount of all improper Medicare payments made to HPBC for hospice services in our sampling frame, it does not represent a specific SIA overpayment amount . However, CMS, acting through a Medicare administrative contractor or other contractor, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures. We will calculate any alternate estimates as necessary to assist CMS in this process. 51 See the Act § 1893(f)(3); CMS MPIM, Pub. No. 100 -08, ch. 8, § 8.4, (effective January 2, 2019).

These claims were extracted from CMS’s National Claims History (NCH) file. We did not assess HPBC’s overall internal control structure. Rather, we limited our review of internal controls to those applicable to our objective. Our audit enabled us to establish reasonable assurance of the authenticity and accuracy of the data obtained from the NCH file , but we did not assess the completeness of the file. We performed fieldwork from October 2019 to December 2021. METHODOLOGY To accomplish our objective, we: • reviewed applicable Medicare laws, regulations, and guidance ; • met with CMS officials to gain an understanding of the Medicare hospice benefit; • had discussions with Palmetto officials to gain an understanding of the Medicare requirements related to hospice services; • met with HPBC’s officials to gain an understanding of its policies and procedures related to providing and billing Medicare for hospice services and reviewed those policies and procedures ; • obtained 37,153 hospice claims , totaling $149,994,36452 from the CMS NCH file, for the audit period ; • excluded 32 claims, totaling $ 144,228, that were identified in the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party; • created a sampling frame consist ing of 37,121 hospice claims, totaling $ 149,850,136 ; • selected a random sample of 100 hospice claims from the sampling frame; 52 The hospice claims extract ed from the CMS NCH file had a payment from the Medicare Trust Fund; however, an individual line can have a zero payment.

SAMPLE UNIT The sample unit was a Medicare Part A hospice claim. SAMPLE DESIGN We used a simple random sample. SAMPLE SIZE We selected a sample of 100 Medicare Part A hospice claims. SOURCE OF THE RANDOM NUMBERS We generated the random numbers with the OIG , Office of Audit Services (OAS) statistical software. METHOD FOR SELECTING SAMPLE ITEMS We consecutively numbered the hospice claims in our sampling frame.  After generating 100 random numbers, we selected the corresponding frame items. ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY We used the OIG/OAS statistical software to estimate the total amount of improper Medicare paymen ts made to HPBC for hospice services in our sampling frame .  To be conservative, we recommend recovery of overpayments at the lower limit of a two -sided 90 -percent confidence interval.  Lower limits calculated in this manner are designed to be less than the actual improper payment total 95 percent of the time. 53 The sampling frame included claims for which a payment was made from the Medicare Trust Fund and claims that were not identified in the RAC data warehouse as having been reviewed by another party.

Javits Federal Building 26 Federal Plaza, Room 3900 New York, NY 10278 Re: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. A-02-20-01001 Dear Ms. Tierney: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (\"HPBC\") appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General\\'s (\"OIG\\'s\") draft report entitled Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (\"Draft Report\"). HPBC\\'s comments to the Draft Report, including the report\\'s conclusions and recommendations , are set forth below.1 INTRODUCTION HPBC is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in Florida, having been established in 1978 by communit y leaders to provide end-of-life care for the area\\'s aging population. Its long\\xadtenured leadership team has over 100 years in combined hospice experience. HPBC is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in Florida, and it was also one of the first 100 hospices to become Medicare-certified. It has also earned The Joint Commiss ion accreditation for meeting the highest performance standards of care, and it created a nationally-r ecognized Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship Program for physicians wishing to specialize in hospice care. 1 This letter and Exhibits 1-2 and 40-41 do not include any protected health information (\"PHI\\'\\'), and therefore we ask that they be attached as an appendix to the OIG\\'s final audit report once it is made public. Exhibits 3-39 do contain PHI, and we ask that these exhibits not be included within the publicly available version of the OIG\\'s final audit report. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 APPENDIX E: HPBC COMMENTS Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 23      BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 2 From a review of only 0.269%2 of the claims for payment that this non-profit hospice submitted to Medicare over a two-year period, the OIG has concluded that it received an alleged overpayment of $42,336,162. This conclusion is based on a review of limited patient medical records by a Medical Review Contractor retained by the OIG to assess whether HPBC admitted patients who qualified for hospice, i.e., had a medical prognosis that his or her life expectanc y is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course, and whether those patients were afforded the appropriate level of care. But, the Medical Review Contractor failed to adhere to the law and standards of practice when reviewing HPBC\\'s claims, and many of its summaries contain factual errors. In response to this Draft Report, HPBC engaged an independent physician who is well\\xadqualified in hospice medicine to evaluate its patient records and the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor \\'s assessments of the claims at issue. This independent expert physician has confirmed that HPBC\\'s patient records supported the reasonable clinical judgments of the HPBC physicians who certified that the patients at issue were eligible for hospice and who determined each patient\\'s appropriate level of hospice care. Significantly, as with other hospice physicians reviewing similar OIG audits, this physician has expressed concern over the apparent lack of understanding of hospice medicine reflected in the Medical Review Contractor \\'s assessments. The Contractor \\'s assessments are misleading, incomplete, focus on irrelevant data points, and, most importantl y, fail to provide any explanation regarding how those data points relate to each patient\\'s prognosis. As detailed in these comments, the Medical Review Contractor clearly disregarded numerous hospice principles set out in CMS guidance documents . It is our understanding the OIG has not independently requested from, nor verified, proof of the qualifications of the physicians or clinicians used by its Medical Review Contractor to review hospice claims. The OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor also failed to apply the appropriate standards for assessing patient eligibility established by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. AseraCare, Jnc.3 Specifically, theAseraCare court explained that a certifying hospice physician\\'s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only ifno reasonable physician , applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit.4 Nothing within the Medical Review Contractor\\'s decisions make this necessary showing. Rather, the Medical Review Contractor merely cherry\\xadpicked discrete bits of information to rationalize its decisions while ignoring the patients\\' overall 2 The OIG reviewed 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims for 1,556 patients cared for by HPBC from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. Of the 100 claims reviewed, the OIG has alleged an overpayment with respect to 40 of those claims, which totaled $148,856. 3 938 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2019) 4 AlthoughAseraCare arose under the False Claims Act, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in its decision that its \"primary task on appeal [was] to clarify the scope of the hospice eligibility requirements, which are set out in the federal Medicare statute\" and its implementing regulations. Id at 1291. Accordingly, this standard governs all applications of the Medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations, including applications in OIG\\'s audit, and is not limited to False Claims Act cases. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 24      BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 3 medical condition , contrary to federal law and the standards of care and practice recognized by the medical community . Contrary to AseraCare, the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor failed to give any deference to the certifying hospice physicians, resulting in the unsupported conclusion that the clinical judgments made by more than 28 different hospice physicians, many of whom have over a decade ( or two) of hospice experience, are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine , and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine ,5 were wrong when certifying these patients, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. 6 This illogical result is possibly explained by the flawed review process. As explained in these comments , the process used by the OIG to evaluate medical necessity may work well for most Medicare items or services, but it is incompatibl e with hospice services. Likewise , the statistical extrapolation process employed by the OIG to convert its review of less than one-half of one percent of HPBC \\'s claims to an overpayment totaling tens of millions of dollars is unfounded. Statistical extrapolation is an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of the practice of hospice medicine because of the individualized nature of prognostication. Even if ell.1rapolation were appropriate, the sampling and extrapolation in this matter have been determined by an expert statistician to be invalid for a number of reasons, any one of which wan-ants the OIG\\'s reconsideration of its use of the sampling and extrapolation to determine the estimated overpayment. The Social Security Act (\"Act\") also supports waiver of the overpaymen ts in this case pursuant to federal law because HPBC submitted the claims at issue in reliance on the clinical judgments of the certifying physicians, which are not shown by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor\\'s summaries to be unreasonable. Lastly, the Draft Report does not include a required offset based on items and services for which there is no dispute regarding medical necessity, such as durable medical equipment, pharmacy, radiology, and labs that Medicare is required to cover regardless of whether the patient was terminally ill. Overall, the Draft Report will significantly decrease beneficiary access to the hospice benefit if it is not reconsidered and revised. If hospices and physicians were to use the criteria and standards used by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor, it will mean some of the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries will not be able to access hospice care until they are showing signs and symptoms of actively dying, which is directly contrary to the intent of Congress and CMS. 7 The active dying process occurs over hours or days, whereas the Medicare hospice 5 For example, six claims denied by the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor are associated with four physicians who have over 10 years\\' experience and are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Two of these physicians also teach hospice medicine. A total of 22 claims that were denied involve patients certified by physicians with over 10 years of experience in hospice medicine. 6 Of the 30 patients denied based on eligibility, two were over I 00 years old, 14 were ages 90-99, and nine were between 86-89 years old. 7 CMS revised the hospice regulations in 1990 to encourage physicians to certify more patients for hospice.

HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 25      BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 4 benefit was meant to provide patients believed by a physician to be in their last six months of life comfort care in order to maintain their (and their families\\') quality of life, dignity, and peace. Beneficiaries should not suffer and be denied access to comfort care as a result of an ill-fitted audit process carried out by an unidentified reviewer whose qualifications and experience are in serious doubt. In light of the foregoing, and as discussed in detail below, the OIG\\'s audit is fundamentall y flawed in numerous respects and, as a result, its overpayment determination is invalid. For these reasons, we respectfully request that the OIG reconsider the claim decisions and the conclusions made in the Draft Report. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON HPBC The Draft Audit Report is wholly inconsistent with HPBC\\'s history, leadership, accreditation, reputation, and culture of compliance. As a historical and locally-based non-profit, with its sole mission to provide families in the community with access to compassionate and quality hospice services, HPBC has taken all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the Medicare program. HPBC is a non-profit hospice that was originally formed by a group of community leaders in 1978 to provide end-of-life care for everyone who needed it, regardless of their ability to pay or financial status. This was before the Medicare hospice benefit existed. At that time, it was one of the first hospices in the area. When Medicare created the hospice benefit in 1983, recognizing the benefits and cost-savings associated with end-of-life care, HPBC became one of the first 100 hospices to be certified. In 2014, HPBC joined together with its sister-location Hospice by the Sea to form Trustbridge, Inc. (formerly known as Spectrum Health, Inc.). Trustbrid ge is currently the largest provider of hospice care in the area. In 2009, HPBC became one of the only hospices to earn The Joint Commission \\'s Gold Seal of Approval for Home Care Accreditation, meaning it has met the most rigorous quality and safety standards of care for patients. As a non-profit corporatio n, HPBC is governed by a Board of Directors, comprised of 10 volunteers from the local community. The members of the Board of Directors are highly credentialed and are actively engaged in HPBC\\'s efforts to provide quality care in compliance with all state and federal laws. The Board is currently chaired by Ms. Barbara Bolton Litten, Esq. Ms. Litten has been a business litigation attorney for over 26 years. Prior to becoming an attorney, she was the Chief Executive Officer of a large not-for-profit corporation based in Southwest Florida. She has been a member of the Board of Directors since 2010. Prior to her becoming chair, Mr. Randy Levitt served in that capacity. Mr. Levitt is a Senior Vice President at Morgan Stanley and is both a CPA and attorney. He served as chairman from 2017 to 2021 and remains on the Board. Two other members of the board are healthcare regulatory attorneys, Marian Pealman Nease and Heather Miller.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 26    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 5 In addition to its Board of Directors, HPBC \\'s current leadership team is very experienced in hospice care and active in the industry. Mr. David Fielding has been the President and Chief Executive Officer since 1998. Prior to taking this role 24 years ago, Mr. Fielding held leadership positions with two other large hospice companies for 9 years. Dr. Faustino Gonzale z, Chief Medical Officer and Medical Director for HPBC, is board-certified in Internal Medicine with an added qualification in Hospice & Palliative Medicine. He has also been a Fellow of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine since 2010. He has over 21 years\\' experience in hospice care, and he has published over 13 peer-review articles and has given more than a dozen presentations at various conferences and symposiums on end-of-life and palliative care, including presentations for the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and the Veterans Administration. HPBC provides exemplary and compliant care to its patients, evidenced by its Gold Seal of Approval for Home Care Accreditation from The Joint Commi ssion, and its survey history. HPBC has been continuousl y accredited by The Joint Commission since 2009. HPBC had no condition-l evel findings on the last two surveys conducted by The Joint Commission in 2018 and 2022. HPBC is also regularly surveyed by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), the agency in Florida that licenses hospices, which is also the state survey agency for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). HPBC had no deficiencies representing serious or immediate risk or harm to patients during the time period at issue or after. Because of its reputation for providing high quality care, HPBC was able to join in a consortium with the Universit y of Miami Miller School of Medicine , JFK Medical Center, and West Palm Beach Veterans Administration Center to create a Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship program. This fellowship program prepares physicians for board-certification in hospice and palliative medicine and was nationally accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2010. As part of a large organization, HPBC has very robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance plan. The OIG confirmed during its exit interview that it had not identified any particular flaw or problem with these policies and procedures. The Draft Report similarly does not identify any specific policy or procedure that is improper or requires modification. Rather, the Draft Report generally indicates HPBC\\'s policies and procedures were ineffective, despite the OIG\\'s own statements there were no particular flaw or problem with the policies.8 HPBC\\'s policies and procedures regarding certification of hospice eligibility are based on the federal statutes and regulations, requiring that the physician determine the patient\\'s eligibility 8 The OIG\\' s position in the Draft Report appears to result from the conclusions of the Medical Review Contractor. In other words, the OIG has concluded that there must be something wrong with HPBC\\'s policies and procedures because the Medical Review Contractor found reason to deny or down-code certain claims. The OIG ignores the more likely explanation: the Medical Review Contractor denied or down-coded claims because the Medical Review Contractor failed to properly apply basic tenets of hospice medicine in a manner consistent with the Medicare hospice benefit. See Exhibit 1, Physician Statement of Dr. Leedy Regarding the OIG\\'s Audit of Hospice of Palm Beach County Inc. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 27    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 6 based on the physician\\'s clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the patient\\'s terminal illness. As required by law, HPBC\\'s policies require the physician to prepare a brief written narrative reflecting the patient\\'s clinical circumstances justifying the terminal prognosis , and expressly require that the clinical information supporting the terminal prognosis be documented in the medical record. All of these patients had signed certifications in which their treating physicians attested that they had a terminal prognosis based on those physicians\\' clinical judgment. Nothing in the policies and procedures encourages or incentivizes physicians or hospice staff to certify ineligible patients for hospice. To the contrary, the policies make clear that if a patient is ineligible, a more appropriate referral will be made. HPBC has taken steps to implement and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures through regular education of its Board members, leadership , physicians, and staff. HPBC has a director of excellenc e and knowledge who coordinates for all physicians and staff necessary training to provide quality care in compliance with the Medicare requirements. During the time period at issue, the HPBC physicians were required to attend education on interdisciplinary group meetings and documentation standards, an annual two-part Rapid Regulatory Compliance program through HealthStream, which included corporate compliance; and Relias LLC educational sessions on physician narratives and relatedness determinations. HPBC\\'s other clinical staff also attended the two-part Rapid Regulatory Complianc e program through HealthStr eam, sessions on prognosti cation tools and hospice eligibility, and several Relias LLC educational sessions touching on the Medicare hospice benefit and its requirements. Physicians and staff alike attend training sessions any time HPBC\\'s policies and procedures are updated. In addition to this training, HPBC\\'s Complianc e Plan ensures the effectiveness of its policies, procedures, and practices. HPBC\\'s Compliance Plan is consistent with the OIG\\'s guidance9 and memorializes the commitm ent of HPBC\\'s Board of Directors and all hospice staff to actively participate and uphold the hospice\\'s commitm ent to compliance. Board members and HPBC\\'s leadership attend annual training on the Compliance Plan. There is also a dedicated, full-time Corporate Compliance Officer, who is supported by a Compliance Department made up of a full-time Director of Compliance and two full-time compliance nurses. In addition to its full-time Complian ce Officer and Compliance Department , HPBC has a Compliance Steering Committee, which provides oversight and direction on regulatory requirement s. The Compliance Department conducts an annual risk assessment, identifying potential areas of risk using internal audit findings as well as governmental guidance and opinions, to develop an audit plan. It then conducts internal audits based on this plan and frequentl y engages outside consultants to conduct reviews. The results of these reviews are documented, trended, and reported to the Compliance Steering Committe e, CEO, the Governance Committee, and the 9 See OIG, Compliance Guidance, http//oig.hhs.gov/compliance/compliance-guidance/index.asp. HPBC confinned with legal counsel in 2018 that its Compliance Plan met both the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines and the OIG\\'s guidelines. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 28    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 7 Board of Directors at least quarterly. Monthly audit findings are reported to the department stakeholders on a regular basis. During the time period at issue, audits were conducted on the use of general inpatient (\"GIP\") care for five or more days, crisis care provided for longer than three days, and patients with a length of stay longer than 180 days. These audits were conducted by pulling a sample on a weekly or bi-monthly basis. Staff counseling and education is conducted if the results reveal a pattern or trend. In addition to conducting audits based on its annual risk assessment, the Compliance Department also conducts investigations based on reports it receives through various sources. All physicians , staff, and volunteers are provided with a Compliance Hotline number to report concerns related to compliance. This toll-free Compliance Hotline number is maintained by a third-party contractor to ensure anonymit y, and it is posted throughout the HPBC offices. The Compliance Department also hosts a \"Complianc e and Ethics Week\" every November, during which staff participate in games designed to educate them on the Compliance Plan and where or how to report compliance concerns, including the Compliance Hotline. All staff members are also asked to review HPBC\\'s Conflict of Interest/Code of Conduct Policy every year and complete an attestation form that asks staff members to disclose compliance-r elated issues. Because of HPBC\\'s culture emphasizing compliance , most compliance reports are received directly by the Corporate Complian ce Officer or Director of Complianc e. A review of the HPBC\\'s reports and internal audits and investigations does not reveal any pattern or systemic problems with respect to eligibility or level of care determinations.10 The effectiveness of the hospice\\'s policies and procedur es and Compliance Plan are demonstrated by CMS \\'s PEPPER reports. PEPPER11 reports provide statistics for key markers used to identify qu estionable billing practices so that hospices may target and improve problematic areas. The reports include data on live discharges, long lengths of stay, 12 and top five diagnoses. For the target areas related to certification of potentiall y ineligible patients, HPBC has been far below the percentile that CMS deems a high risk for improper payments (the 80th percentile). With respect to long lengths of stay, HPBC \\'s PEPPER repo1i for the three federal fiscal years through fiscal year 201913 showed that only 10.1 % of its patients had a long length of stay, putting HPBC in the 19.8 percentile nationwide. This means 80.2% of hospices nationwide had a higher percentage of patients with long lengths of stay as compared to HPBC 10 HPBC\\'s culture of compliance is further demonstrated by voluntary repayments made in the past in response to its internal investigations. On December 22, 2017, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto in the amount of $91,623.83 for evaluation and management services performed by physician, Dr. Randy Fox, which were determined to be potential overpayments using a statistically valid random sample. On March 4, 2020, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration after determining physician narratives for two patients were potentially defective. On March 18, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Pahnetto for GIP claims submitted for three patients that were determined to be potential overpayments following an internal investigation that involved detailed chart reviews. 11 Program for Evaluating Payment Patterns Electronic Report (\"PEPPER\"). tz Long Length of Stay patients are those whose combined days of service is greater than 180 days. 13 For federal fiscal year (\"FY\") 2019 (October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019).

In other words, the PEPPER reports reflect HPBC surpassed most other hospices with respect to accurate prognosticati on. HPBC recognize s that, like all providers, it is not infallible. However, its history, leadership, policies and procedures, Compliance Plan, ongoing staff and physician education, and overall culture make it apparent that any issues that occur are aberrant and far from widespread. The OIG\\'s conclusion to the contrary ignores HPBC\\'s background, policies, and culture and is indicative of an overzealous medical review contractor that appears to lack a clear understanding of the hospice standard of practice, as well as the statutes and regulations governing hospice. IfOIG\\'s conclusion were correct, it would mean that the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians , who personally treated the patients and had absolutely no incentive to improperly admit them for hospice care, was incorrect. Such conclusion lacks credibility when considering the foregoing information. RESPONSE TO THE OIG\\'S DRAFT REPORT I. Swnmary of the Draft Report In this audit, the OIG reviewed a very narrow snapshot ofHPBC \\'s overall operat ions. As a part of its audit, the OIG selected a random sample of 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims submitted by HPBC for the time period of April 2017 to March 2019, which represents 0.269% of the claims submitted by HPBC for that time period. The 100 claims selected by the OIG were associated with only one month (or less) of hospice services provided to 100 different hospice patients. During that time period, HPBC provided hospice care to 12,762 Medicare beneficiaries and received $149,850,136 in Medicare reimbursement. After requesting and receiving records from HPBC for these 100 patients for this one month or less of service, the OIG then had its Medical Review Contractor review the records. The OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor determined that 60 of the claims met all Medicare requirements, while 40 of the claims did not. Of those 40 claims, 30 were denied because the Medical Review Contractor concluded that records accompanying the properly signed physician certification or recertification did not support the medical prognosis of a terminal illness; 7 were downcoded from a higher level of care to the routine home care level of care because, although the patient was clinically eligible for hospice services, the Medical Review Contractor concluded that the documentation did not support the higher level of care; and three were partially denied because the Medical Review Contractor concluded that the service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") payment was not supported.14 14 As a result of the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC learned of an error in its E.MR system that created minor Service Intensity Add-on (\"SIA\") overpayments for some patients. Due to the nature of the technological issue, HPBC is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 30    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 9 The OIG extrapolated the error rate for the sample of claims determined by its Medical Review Contractor to the entire universe of claims submitted by HPBC to Medicare during the two-year time frame for this audit. As a result of the extrapolation, the OIG alleges in its Draft Report that HPBC received approximately $42,336,162 in improper payments. Nothing in the Draft Report suggests that HPBC acted fraudulently or that it knowingly submitted incorrect information to the government. The OIG concludes its report by making three recommendations: (1) refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. In the next sections of this letter, HPBC provides its analysis of the Draft Report and then responds to these recommendations. II, Analysis of the OIG\\'s Audit Process and Determinations A. The Clinical Documentation for the Claims Reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor Met All Requirements . HPBC provided properly signed and clinically supported physician certifications and recertifications for each patient whose claim was denied by the Medical Review Contractor. HPBC also provided documentation demonstrating that the patients who received a higher level of hospice care in fact required that level of care. Highly trained and experienced physicians signed these certifications and made level of care determinations using their clinical judgment, basing their judgment on the patients\\' conditions. This audit involves rejection of the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians who personally treated the patients at issue, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. Many of these physicians have worked in hospice for years and are Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine. Some of them are Fellows in the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, the highest honor that can be bestowed on a Board-certified hospice physician. Some of them even teach hospice and palliative medicine. Rejecting the clinical judgments of these physicians impugns their expertise and reputation. HPBC engaged an independent physician with impeccable credentials, Dr. Stephen A. Leedy, MD, MA, HMDC, F AAHPM, to further analyze the Medical Review Contractor\\'s findings and conclusions. 15 Dr. Leedy assessed the medical records that were provided to the OIG and confirmed, as set forth in the individual patient responses included with this letter (\"Patient Response Summarie s\"), 16 that the certifications of terminal illness and the levels of care overpayment amount. Once it has completed this quantifica tion, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Palmetto the total SIA overpayment amount. 15 See Exhibit 2, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Leedy. 16 See Exhibits3-39. These exhibits are comprised ofHPBC\\'sresponses to the bases for the OIG\\'s claim denials. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 31    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 10 for those patients were supported by the medical records. These conclusions by Dr. Leedy are supported by his extensive experience with hospice, as well as peer-reviewed medical literature, to which he cites in the Patient Response Summaries.17 The Medical Review Contractor\\'s decisions for these patients, on the other hand, are not supported by the medical records, are rife with factual errors, fail to apply fundamental principles of hospice medicine as recognized by the medical community, and fail to include citation to any relevant medical literature. The Medical Review Summaries use the same or similar boilerplate language for each claim at issue, which is indicative of the Contractor\\'s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and thoroughly review the medical records provided by HPBC. This approach evidences a results-oriented outcome approach in which the Contractor cherry-picked discrete bits of information to support its denials while disregarding other facts in the record supporting the patients\\' terminal prognoses. Dr. Leedy has provided a Physician Statement expressing his deep disappointment and concern over the lack of understanding of hospice eligibility reflected in the \"Rationale\" of the Medical Review Summaries.18 In his Physician Statement, Dr. Leedy details how the Contractor\\'s analyses are inconsistent with the standard of practice, undermine the purpose of hospice care, and are antithetical to the hospice benefit. He further describes how the Rationales across patients are contradictory and downplay or ignore key clinical data in favor of select details cherry-picked from the medical records. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s lack of understanding is best shown through the following examples: 17 Dr. Leedy cited to the following in the Patient Response Summaries: De Stefani, Pietraroia, Fernandes-Silva, et al., Observational Evidence for Unintentional Weight Loss in All-Cause Mortality and Major Cardiovascu lar Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis , 8 SCI.

This 92-year-old patient had a primary diagnosis of senile degeneration of the brain with a Functional Assessment Staging Tool (\"FAST\") score of7C and a Palliative Performanc e Scale (\"PPS\") score of only 30%, as well as numerous prognosis\\xadimpacting comorbid and secondary conditions, including osseous defects in her right shoulder and right leg, muscle weakness, and a coccygeal wound. She also required a potent transdermal opioid analgesic for hip and low back pain, and she suffered from anorexia, eating less than 25% of meals. During the denied month of service, she exhibited severe nutritional compromise, and multiple factors documented throughout the medical record support that she was significantly malnourish ed. Accordingly, Dr. Leedy concluded from his review of the medical record that this patient had a terminal prognosis during these dates of service and was appropriately certified. The Contractor provided several irrelevant clinical points to support the unfavorable decision, many of which indicated a misplaced focus on body mass index (\"BMI\"), which is not required to demonstrate hospice eligibility, to the exclusion of other information bearing on terminality. Specifically, the Contractor glossed over this patient\\'s unintention al weight loss of 4.6% of her body weight in only 6 weeks, her increased contractures and kyphosis that made it difficult to measure her height, her dysphagia, and her anorexia that impaired her nutritional intake. In addition to concluding that this patient was eligible, Dr. Leedy opined that the Contractor \"selectively ignored information in the medical record to reach a misguided conclusion .\" • Sample #9 -The Contractor determined Sample #9, who met the LCD guidelines, was not eligible for hospice services for dates of service September 29-30, 2017. This 78-year-old patient had a primary diagnosis offrontotemporal dementia with a FAST score of 7 A and several comorbid and secondary conditions contributing to her terminal prognosis. Notably, she had lost 10.4% of her body weight in under 2 months and was anorexic and cachectic. The Contractor relied on factually false and immaterial factors in finding her ineligible. For example, the Contractor noted \"that there was no documentation of ongoing weight loss,\" which is directly contradicted in the medical record and would have been apparent had the Contractor not artificially and inappropriately constrained the review to just two days of care. Similarly, despite acknowledging her FAST score of 7 A, which meets the applicable Palmetto LCD guidelines, the Contractor determined this patient to be ineligible, ignoring clinical factors indicating a progression towards 7C and downplaying the significance of her staggeringl y low BMI of just 16. Dr. Leedy concluded that this patient was eligible for hospice services and added that the Contractor \\'s \"woefully inadequate understand ing of the details of hospice eligibility, including what appears to be a complete lack of reference to LCD guidelines, and evidence of inadequate medical record review, calls into questions the validity of the review.\" HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc.

This 91-year-old patient had a primary hospice diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease and a PPS score of only 10%, meaning she was comatose and not consuming anything by mouth. Dr. Leedy concluded that she was eligible for CHC services during this three-day period because she required a higher level of care for the unstable vital signs oftachypnea (labored breathing) and tachycardia ( elevated heart rate), in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain. Notably, she died on the final day of the denied dates of service. Yet, the Contractor commented that the \"documentation does not support that she was in crisis.\" To the contrary, Dr. Leedy\\'s review of the records revealed \"clear signs of distress, including pain and dyspnea,\" which are \"exactly the situation that warrants CHC.\" In fact, the care provided in this case is \"an exemplar of the successful use of CHC,\" as the patient was able to die peacefully in her own home. • Sample #78 ~ The Contractor determined Sample #78 was not eligible for GIP care for dates of service September 1-8, 2017. This 81-year-old patient had a primary diaguosis of acute catastrophic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident and a PPS of 20% that further declined to 10% on September 3, 2017. He was admitted to hospice at the GIP level of care following an emergency room visit for a severe stroke and significant neurologic symptoms. Dr. Leedy agreed with the decision to initiate GIP services because this patient\\'s unstable medical condition (including worsening tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, pain, lung congestion, and agitation) and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure due to the severity of his brain damage required around\\xadthe-clock nursing monitoring and frequent administration of several intravenous medications. He died on the final day of the denied dates of service. The Contractor \\'s claim that \"[t]here is no documentation that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered\" is blatantly inaccurate. Moreover, the Contractor \\'s comment that \"[a]s needed medication was required rarely\" misrepresents this patient\\'s fragile condition and the need for frequent intervention. According to Dr. Leedy, it is incorrect to suggest that this patient was not eligible for GIP services because the many medications needed to control his worsening symptoms were promptly scheduled rather than administered on an as-needed basis. The irrationality of the above-referenced claim denials is perhaps explained by the flawed review process. HPBC\\'s independent expert physician has expressed concern with the OIG\\'s process ofreviewing only one month of records ( or less) for each hospice patient. Reviewing documents supporting a single claim may be appropriate for auditing the medical necessity of a single item or service, but it is not well suited for hospice, which involves prognostication of life HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 34    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 13 expectancy based on the patient\\'s \"complete medical picture\"19 and ongoing, multidisciplinary treatment. Conducting a limited review of only one month ( or less) of a hospice patient\\'s records does not provide a \"complete medical picture\" of the patient\\'s condition to allow for prognostication within the standard of practice. Dr. Leedy confirms this in his Physician Statement. Although he believes the records reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor adequately supported the patients\\' eligibility and level of care, the OIG should have sought and reviewed the patients\\' other records ifthere was any doubt concerning their eligibility or level of care. Compounding this issue is the fact that this limited review was performed by someone whose name and credentials are unknown to the OIG. Taking into consideration the clinical judgment of the original certifying physicians, the attached Patient Response Summari es prepared by Dr. Leedy, and Dr. Leedy\\'s Physician Statement, it is apparent there are flaws in the process used by the Medical Review Contractor, which warrants reconsideration of the OIG\\'s audit process, claim denials, and conclusions made in the Draft Report. B. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s Denials Are Inconsistent with the Law and Guidance Concerning the Medicare Hospice Benefit. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s determinations regarding the terminal status of the patients at issue are inconsistent with the law governing hospice services and hospice eligibility determinations. As described below and in the attached Patient Response Summaries prepared by Dr. Leedy, the Medical Review Contractor\\'s determinations failed to follow the appropriat e standards and principles governing hospice eligibility. When applying the correct standards for eligibility under the Medicare hospice benefit, it is clear that the beneficiaries were eligible, and the level of care was appropriate. 1. The Medical Review Contractor Failed to Apply Many of the Well\\xadEstablished Hospice Principles. The Draft Report is inconsistent with many well-established hospice principles, described further below, but it is important to note at the outset that the Medical Review Contractor\\'s summaries of the records were often factually incorrect. As just one example, the Contractor denied the eligibility of a 103-year-old with a primary hospice diagnosis of atherosclerot ic heart disease, purported ly because she did not have any documented chest pain or documented pain. However, the records clearly documente d that this non-verbal patient had generalized pain and analgesics were administered to control it throughout the time period under review.20 While these errors have been addressed in the individual Patient Response Summaries, we point them out here because they call into question the validity of the entire review. 19 See AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1293; 42 C.F.R. § 418.102(b). 20 See OIG Medical Review Summary for Sample #71; see also Exhibit 28.

Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 14 The absence of decline during a single month under review is not a proper reason to conclude that a beneficiary does not have a terminal illness.21 CMS has \"also acknowledge[d] that at recertification, not all patients may show measurable decline.\"22 Based on CMS guidance, a federal district court has excluded proposed expert testimony that would have claimed that a patient must show decline to remain eligible for hospice.23 Despite this well\\xadestablished principle, the OIG\\'s Medical Review Contractor repeatedly denied eligibility based on the fact that the patient had not \"significantly declined.\"24 This basis for denial is contrary to the position of CMS and what the court in Vista Hospice Care identified as the appropriate interpretation of the hospice benefit. Moreover, these patients actually declined, but the Contractor still denied their eligibility because the decline was slow or not \"significant.\" For one patient, the Contractor acknowledged the patient had declined but indicated the decline was \"slow in progressing[.]\"25 For a 90-year-old patient with a primary diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma with extrasellar ell.-tension (meaning a tumor growing in the pituitary gland in the brain that has extended beyond the gland and into the surrounding tissue), the Contractor focused on a CT scan that showed the tumor had not grown, disregarding the patient\\'s nine hospitalizations, weight loss, falls, and a decline in functional abilities evidenced by a decreasing PPS score. 26 Even if decline were required, these patients did experience decline during the denied dates of service, as detailed in the Patient Response Summaries. Therefore, as a matter oflaw, claim denials based merely on the absence of decline are improper. Moreover, as a matter of fact, claim denials based on the absence of decline, when there actually was decline, are improper as well. 21 See Vista Hospice Care, No. 3:07-CV-00604-M, 2016 WL 3449833, at *16 (ND.

Patient improvement or stabilization does not disqualify a person from the hospice benefit. CMS has long recognized that apparent improvement in an individual\\' s symptoms may not mean that the individual\\'s prognosis has improved.27 Hospices treat the whole person using a multidisciplinary approach, which often results in an improvement or stabilization of symptoms. CMS has thus acknowledged that it can be difficult to distinguish a sustainable stabilization in a patient\\'s condition from the impression of stabilization that could not be maintained by the patient if discharged from hospice. This point was reaffirmed inAseraCare, discussed infra, where the court acknowledged that, because predicting life expectanc y is not an exact science, the Medicare framework recognizes that \"patients with an initial prognosis of terminality can improve over time\" without losing their right to coverage. 28 Here, however, the Medical Review Contractor improperly denied claims based on patients\\' purported improvement or stabilization.29 For example, the Contractor denied patients whose weight remained stable or had improved , failing to recognize that some of the weight gain experienced by these patients had negative prognostic implications. 30 As another example, the Contractor denied the eligibility of a 97-year-old patient with untreated stomach cancer because her pain was \"well managed\" by the hospice.31 However, the fact that the hospice was providing the patient with large doses of opioid analgesics to keep her escalating pain caused by a progressive stomach neoplasm in check does not mean her prognosis had improved. The Contractor also denied the eligibility of a 90-year-old patient who weighed only 100 pounds because she was given Marino!, an appetite stimulate , and she began to eat 100% of her meals, despite the fact that this patient\\'s primary diagnosis was cerebral atherosclerosis , the LCD for which does not require any weight loss or poor appetite.32 Even if these factors were appropriately interpreted by the Contractor to be signs of improvement of the patients\\' prognoses (which the hospice denies), it remains improper to discharge a patient until the hospice has sufficient evidence that the stabilization or improvement can be maintained. If the hospice has sufficient evidence to make that determination, it appropriat ely discharges patients with an extended prognosis, as evidenced by the records reviewed by the Contractor.33 27 70 Fed.

It is clear that the Medical Review Contractor improperly made clinical eligibility determinations using the benefit of hindsight, rather than evaluating the records from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided. The applicable regulation and Medicare Benefit Policy Manual make clear that the certification of a patient\\'s eligibility for hospice must be based on the patient\\'s medical records or examination of the patient at the time of the certification. 34 Several court cases have overturned denials related to eligibility for certain Medicare benefits that \"impermissibly relied on the benefit of hindsight, which of course is always 20-20.\"35 For example, when Medicare contractors denied skilled nursing care because the records showed the patient was stable throughout the certification period, courts overturned the denials because \"[t]he services must ... be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient when the services were ordered and what was, at that time, reasonably expected to be appropriat e treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period. \"36 Further, courts have noted that Medicare beneficiaries shouldn\\'t have to risk deterioration to their health in order to validate the care they\\'re receiving.37 These same principles equally apply to hospice and are consistent with the CMS guidance .38 For many of the patients denied on the basis that they were not eligible, the Medical Review Contractor appears to have relied on the fact that certain symptoms were not documented for these patients during the month under review. For every patient denied based on eligibility, regardles s of diagnosis, the Contractor cited that the patients did not have documentation of any stage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections , or sepsis, none of which are required by any applicable LCD. Some patients actually experienced these signs or symptoms , but the Contractor did not count them because the patient responded to treatment. For example, one patient was hospitalized twice between January 2018 and April 2018 for pneumonia, but the Contractor denied his eligibility for the month of June 2018 because he did not have any documented aspiration pneumonia.39 For other patients, recurrent urinary tract infections did not count as \"frequent infections\" to support the patients\\' eligibility because, according to the Contractor, the infections responded to antibiotics.40 34 See 42 C.F.R. § 418.22(b)(3)(iii); see also, CMS, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, CMS Pub.

HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 38    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 17 It would have been impossible for the hospice physician to know at the time of certification, or even during portions of the month-long period under review, that the beneficiary would not experience these issues or, if they were experiencing these issues, would respond well to treatment. Moreover , even the Medical Review Contractor could only know with the improper use of hindsight that, for example, a patient ultimatel y would not experience these signs and symptoms during the month at issue or the patients\\' symptoms would resolve. Yet, the Medical Review Contractor denied the entire claim rather than define when exactly within that month the failure to experience a specific sign or symptom should result in a change to the patient\\'s prognosis.41 Furthermore , by focusing on these specific symptom s, the Contractor is not only conducting a hindsight evaluation of the records but is also ignoring other important signs and symptom s relevant to determining a patient\\'s terminal prognosis, which are described further below and in the Patient Response Summaries. Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the Contractor improperly applied a retrospective analysis to the question of each beneficiary\\'s eligibility, in direct contravention of CMS guidance and case law. Therefore, the denials must be reconsidered and redetermined without the improper use of hindsight . d. Clinical benchmark s are not required to demonstrate tenninalit y. Law and guidance has made clear that in enacting the statutory and regulatory framework governing hospice, Congress and CMS \"were careful to place the physician\\'s clinical judgment at the center of the inquiry,\" and specifically chose not to impose \"a more rigid set of criteria for eligibility determinations that would have minimized the role of clinical judgment.\"42 Indeed, the AseraCare court explained, \"CMS has considered and expressly declined to impose defined criteria that would govern the physician \\'s exercise ofjudgment. \"43 Instead, the determin ation of hospice eligibility under Medicare is \"centered on the subjective \\'clinical judgment\\' of a physician as to a patient\\'s life expectancy. ,.i4 Further, in 2008, CMS proposed a rule that would identify \"criteria\" that must be considered in certifying patients as terminall y ill,45 but subsequently removed the word \"criteria,\" however, \"in order to remove any implication that there are specific CMS clinical benchmarks in this rule that must be met in order to certify terminal illness.\\'.i6 Accordingly, it is improper to rely on specific clinical criteria to deny eligibility. 41 Additionally, this is yet another instance in which the hospice is being punished for providing good care that prevented patients from having ulcers or infections. 42 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1301. 43 Id 44 Id at 1291. 45 See Vista Hospice Care, 2016 WL 3449833, at *3. 46 See id (quoting 73 Fed.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 39    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 18 Here, contrary to AseraCare and CMS guidance, the Medical Review Contractor relied on the absence of a certain set of clinical criteria in order to deny the eligibility of beneficiarie s despite the fact that these beneficiaries showed numerous other signs and symptoms that supported their eligibility. For all of the patients denied on the basis of eligibility, the Contractor cited the purported lack of stage III or IV pressure ulcers, aspiration pneumonia, frequent infections , or sepsis, regardless of the patient\\'s primary diagnosis, as if all hospice patients undoubtedly show such symptoms and the lack of such symptoms is proof the person is not eligible. Because a predetermined list of clinical benchmark s is not required to support a terminal prognosis, it was inappropriate for the Contractor to rely on the lack of those symptoms as a basis to deny the patients access to the hospice benefit. Further, using such clinical benchmarks without regard to the patient\\'s whole condition is inconsistent with clear directives from CMS.47 It also bears repeating that many of these patients had experienc ed these signs and symptoms, but the Contractor improperly ignored or downplayed them. e. LCDs are not requirements-they are \"safe harbors.\" It is well-establish ed that Local Coverage Determinations (\"LCDs\") are guidelines, \"not clinical benchmarks or mandatory requirements for hospice eligibility.\"48 Indeed, they \"are not binding and should not be considered \\'the exact criteria used for determining \\' terminal illness.\"49 Thus, \"[m ]eeting the clinical criteria in the LCDs for the patient\\'s primary diagnosis is one path to eligibility under the [Medicare Hospice Benefit], but hospices may \\'otherwise demonstrate to the [MAC] that the patient has a terminal prognosis. \"\\'50 Each of the OIG\\'s Medical Review Summaries cite to an LCD to deny the claims at issue. 51 Under applicabl e law, however, meeting an LCD is a basis to approve a claim, but failure to meet an LCD is not a basis to deny a claim. The Medical Review Summaries fail to make a critical and necessary determina tion, i.e., that the medical record for the patient at issue did not support a terminal proguosis even outside the constraints of the LCD. Accordin gly, it is improper to deny these patients\\' eligibility based on a purported failure to \"meet\" an LCD. The Medical Review Contractor \\'s determinations should be reconsider ed in light of the appropriate use of LCDs. 47 Medicare Program; FY 2015 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update; Hospice Quality Reporting Requirements and Process and Appeals for Part D Payment for Drugs for Beneficiaries Enrolled in Hospice, 79 Fed.

The Medical Review Contractor Failed to Apply the Law Consistent with the Recent AseraCare Decision. The medical review determinations referenced in the Draft Report are inconsistent with the central holdings of AseraCare,52 a landmark decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which identified the governing standards for evaluating hospice eligibility determinations. HPBC is located within the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit, andAseraCare is the governing law for HPBC and for the federal government in that jurisdiction. As noted earlier, althoughAseraCare arose under the False Claims Act, the standards set out in the decision applies to all applications of the Medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations.53 Based on a comprehensive analysis of this legal framewor~ the AseraCare court expounded upon three standards that govern any audit of hospice services, including the present one: ( 1) a \"clinical standard,\" which holds that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong; (2) a \"documentation standard,\" which requires only that the medical record support the physician \\'s clinical determination as to hospice eligibility, rather than prove the determination as a \"matter of medical fact\"; and (3) a \"competency standard,\" which permits a later reversal of certifying physicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations only if a competent reviewer (i.e., a qualified physician ) finds that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was hospice eligible. Here, the Medical Review Contractor\\'s analysis falls short of all three of these standards. a. The Clinical Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Improperly Based Its Determinations on a Reasonable Disagreement with the Hospice Physicians. In its decision, the AseraCare court made clear that \"the clinical judgment of the patient\\'s attending physician (or the provider\\'s medical director, as the case may be) lies at the center of the eligibility inquiry. \"54 The court further recognized: CMS\\'s rulemaking commentary signals that well-founded clinical judgments should be granted deference [and] .... the law is designed to give physicians meaningful latitude to make informed judgments without fear that those judgments will be second-guessed after the fact by laymen in a liability proceeding. 55 52 938 F.3d 1278 (I Ith Cir. 2019). \" See supra note 3. 54 Id at 1293. 55 Id at 1295. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 41    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 20 As the Court further explained, \"[n]othing in the statutory or regulatory framework suggests that a clinical judgment regarding a patient\\'s prognosis is invalid or illegitimate merely because an unaffiliated physician reviewing the relevant records after the fact disagrees with that clinical judgment. \"56 TheAseraCare court\\'s holding is consistent with Congress and CMS\\'s prior acknowledgment of the hospice physician\\'s central role and the complexitie s and uncertainties involved in prognostication. CMS has acknowledged that \"[i]t is the physician\\'s responsibi lity to assess the patient\\'s medical condition and determine if the patient can be certified as terminall y ill.\"57 The recognition of the hospice physician\\'s central role, both by CMS and the court in AseraCare, is consistent with other cases requiring \"extra weight\" or deference be given to a treating physician \\'s contemporaneous informed opinion unless there is a reasoned basis for declining to do so. 58 CMS has also long recognized that a terminal prognosis is far from a \"guarantee\" of death within six months, and some patients have the \"good fortune to live longer than predicted by a well-intentioned physician.\"59 \"The fact that a beneficiary lives longer than expected in itself is not cause to terminate benefits.\"60 Because prognostication is not an exact science, hospice physicians do not need to prognosticate with 100% certainty to establish a patient\\'s eligibility for hospice. Rather, CMS has stated that eligibility for hospice exists for patients whose clinical status is \"more likely than not to result in a life expectancy of six months or less. \"61 Congress confirmed this approach to hospice eligibility when it eliminated the 210-day limit on the Medicare hospice benefit. 62 TheAseraCare court also recognized that \"predicting life expectancy is not an exact science,\" and no \"certitude can be expected of physicians in the practice of treating end-of-life illness. ,\\'63 As a result, the court concluded that there are vagaries in prognostica tion that can lead to divergent, yet equally valid and supported , predictions of life expectanc y. The court did not consider it appropriate or a valid application of the Medicare hospice benefit to allow a mere difference of opinion between clinicians to result in an adverse consequence for the hospice. If anything, the hospice physician is entitled to \"meaningful latitude\" in his or her prognostication s. 64 \\'6 Id at 1296. 57 70 Fed. Reg. at 70539. \\'8 Exec. Dir. of Office of Vt.

(A-02-20-01001 ) 42    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 21 In other words, under AseraCare, two reasonable physicians using their clinical judgment can come to two different conclusions about a patient\\'s prognosis (and therefore hospice eligibility), and neither would be wrong. Accordingly, a later reversal of a certifying physician\\'s hospice eligibility determination is appropriate only ifno reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit. This standard gives appropriate deference to the certifying physicians, as required by the hospice legal framework and in numerous other cases. Nowhere in the Draft Report, nor in its enclosed documentation , did the OIG reference the appropriate standard described inAseraCare or even identify any standard its Contractor used for the after-the-fact evaluation of the hospice physicians \\' clinical judgment. The Medical Review Contractor does not indicate at any point in its Medical Review Summari es that no reasonable physician could have certified the patients as hospice-eligible. Rather, the Medical Review Contractor has shown, at best, that based on its post hoc review of certain records, it merely disagreed with the clinical judgment of the skilled and experienced physicians who ce1tified the patients as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients\\' circumstances and the physician s\\' best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the normal course of the patients\\' terminal illnesses. Likewise, the Medical Review Summaries do not set forth a reasoned basis for declining to give weight or deference to the certifying physicians. Under AseraCare, that is not enough to refute the hospice physicians \\' equally reasonable conclusion (reached based on the physicians\\' clinical judgment at the time they were treating the patients) that the patients had a terminal prognosis. The OIG cannot base its Draft Report only on a reasonable disagreement between the physicians who certified and recertified these patients (i.e., the physicians who actually cared for the patients and appropriately applied their clinical judgment to make eligibility determinations ) and its Medical Review Contractor who reviewed those certification s years later. The law requires more, yet the Medical Review Summaries fail to provide it. b. The Documentation Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Improperly Demanded that the Medical Record Prove, Rather than Support, a Patient\\'s Terminal Prognosis. The AseraCare court recognized that, under the plain language of the Medicare Statute and implementing regulations , \"a patient is eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit if the appropriate physician makes a clinical judgment that the patient is terminally ill in light of the patient\\'s complete medical picture, as evidenced by the patient\\'s medical records.\"65 However , the court held that the medical record supportin g the physician \\'s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment , explaining: 65 Id at 1293 (emphasis added). HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 43    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 22 Importantly, none of the relevant language states that the documentary record underpinning a physician\\'s clinical judgment must prove the prognosis as a matter of medical fact. ... Nor does this framework state or imply that the patient\\'s medical records must unequivocally demonstrate to an unaffiliated physician, reviewing the records after the fact, that the patient was likely to die within six months of the time the certifying physician\\'s clinical judgment was made.66 In other words, AseraCare held that the physician \\'s clinical judgment is the \"controlling condition of reimbursement\" and supporting documentation need not, \"standing alone, prove the validity of the physician\\'s initial clinicaljudgm ent.\"67 If such were the case, the physician certification requirement would be superl1uous. The Medical Review Contractor\\'s analyses and resulting determination s do not reflect the current standard for evaluating the hospice medical record, as set forth in AseraCare. The Contractor \\'s findings that the document ation did not support patient eligibility or level of care is flawed because the Contractor cited only cherry-picked factors tending to support its denials while completel y disregarding other highly probative facts that supported the patients\\' certifications and recertifications and level of care detenninations. Identification of a few discrete facts that could only arguably support their conclusions that the patients were not terminally ill or did not require the level of care received-a point that HPBC emphatically rejects-does not satisfy the standard for evaluating documentation under AseraCare. At best, the Contractor\\'s determinations accomplish nothing more than stating that the medical record supports two divergent opinions regarding terminality, which fails to demonstrate that the patients were certified in error. By ignoring other facts in the record supportin g the certifications and recertifications, the OIG Medical Review Contractor applied a much more exacting standard in the course of its review. Accordingly, the Medical Review Summari es should be rejected. c. The Competency Standard: The Medical Review Contractor Is Not Qualified to Evaluate the Exercise of Clinical Judgment by the Experienced Hospice Physician s. FollowingAseraCar e, it is clear that the post hoc scrutiny of treating physicians\\' contemporaneous \"properly formed and sincerely held clinicaljudgment[s]\" is not enough to undermine the physicians \\' eligibility determinations . 68 Rather, a reversal of certifying physicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations is appropriate only if, based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant medical records, one can conclude that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the 66 Id at 1293-94. 67 Id at 1291, 1294. 68 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1297.

A necessary corollary of this holding (and the first two standards described above) is a requirement that the individuals conducting this post hoc review be qualified to provide \"a reasonable interpretation \" of the medical record to determine what a \"reasonable physician\" would or would not conclude. In other words, under the central principles outlined inAseraCare , only a trained hospice physician is competent to evaluate the exercise of clinical judgment by the experienced hospice physicians. Here, HPBC\\'s skilled and experienced physician s certified the patients reviewed by the Medical Review Contractor as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients\\' circumstances and the physicians \\' best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the normal course of the patients\\' terminal illnesses. HPBC\\'s physicians\\' clinical judgment was further reviewed and affirmed by Dr. Leedy, who is Board-certified in Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine and a Fellow of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.69 The OIG, on the other hand, has not identified either the Medical Review Contractor or the physicians who reviewed, and ultimately disagreed with, the certifying physician s\\' contemporaneous eligibility and level of care detern1ination s, much less identified their credentials and qualifications . 70 It is concerning that the OIG has refused to provide more detail concerning the physician reviewers\\' qualifications so that its audit process is as transparent and credible as possible. Even when HPBC requested this infonnation , the OIG responded that it does not obtain the physician reviewer resumes but relies, instead, on the generic representation s made by the Medical Review Contractor during the competitiv e bidding process regarding the qualifications of the reviewers. We have included with this letter copies of our independent expert physician\\'s curriculum vitae.71 It is difficult to fathom how the OIG can find a completely anonymous reviewer more credible than the certifying physicians and Dr. Leedy, who are highly experienced in hospice and well-credentialed. Dr. Leedy\\'s Physician Statement makes clear that the qualifications of the Medical Review Contractor\\'s anonymous reviewers are in serious doubt. Numerous other providers have recently raised concern about the qualifications of the Medical Review Contractor \\'s medical reviewer.72 The OIG\\'s failure to verify the qualifications of the Contractor\\'s reviewers after 69 See Exhibit 2. 70 The end of each Medical Review Summary includes the following generic statement: The physician who reviewed this case is licensed to practice medicine, is knowledgeable in the treatment of the emollee\\'s medical condition, and is familiar with guidelines and protocols in the area of treatment under review. Additionally, the physician holds a current certification from a recognized American medical specialty board in an area appropriate to the treatment of services under review, and has no history of disciplinary action or sanctions against their license. 71 See Exhibit 2. 72 See, e.g., OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: Mission Home Health of San Diego (Aug. 2020), at page 12; OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: SuncoastHospice (May 2021), at page 22; OIG, Medicare Home Health Agency Provider Compliance Audit: Ambercare Hospice, Inc.

It also renders the Draft Report not credible. And, under recent guidance issued to all administrative agencies, withholding information concerning the reviewers \\' qualification s is a derogation of the provider\\'s due process rights.73 In conclusion, the OIG has not demonstrated-and cannot demonstrate based on this review-that no reasonable physician would conclude that HPBC\\'s patients were eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit. The OIG\\'s conclusions , therefore, fall short of the standards required under AseraCare. 3. The Failure to Apply the Correct Legal Principle s for Hospice E ligibility is Arbitrary and Capricious. The Medical Review Contractor failed to recognize the above well-established principles, in addition to those further detailed inAseraCare, in its retrospective evaluation of the hospice physicians\\' contemporaneous determinations regarding eligibility for hospice and level of care. The determinations of the trained hospice physicians , which were made in real time-some after seeing the patient in person while conducting the face-to-face visit-are more credible and, importantly, more significant under applicable hospice law and regulations, than the review process performed by the Medical Review Contractor. To avoid an \"arbitrary and capricious\" determination , the decision must evidence that the OIG \"examined the relevant data and provided an explanation of its decision that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"74 Here, the Medical Review Contractor repetitively and rotely cited clinical criteria that are not legally mandatory and cherry\\xadpicked evidence from the medical record without a holistic consideration of each patient\\'s condition , without taking into account the hospice physicians\\' credible clinical judgments. The Contractor also failed to connect the facts and information about each patient to the determination that the documentation was insufficient.

This failure to apply the correct legal principles and connect them to the patients results in arbitrary and capricious determinations by the OIG.75 C. The Extrapolation of the Alleged Overpaym ent Here is Invalid and Inappropriate . We ask that the OIG reconsider its use of sampling and extrapolation to arrive at the estimated overpayment here for at least two reasons. First, extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication. Second, the OIG\\'s statistical methodology was fundamentally flawed, and the extrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid. 1. Extrapolation is Not Appropriate for Calculating Hospice Overpayments Given The Individuali zed Nature of Prognostication. The OIG\\'s attempted calculation of an overpayment amount through statistical sampling and extrapolation fails to take into consideration the unique nature of hospice, including each hospice patient\\'s relevant clinical profile, and the subjective and inexact nature of each hospice physician\\'s prognostication. Such an attempted calculation premised on clinical eligibility for hospice cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimated overpayment. The definitions of eligibility for hospice care are not operationally defined because of the need for subjective clinical judgments by individual physicians in the hospice context. Consequently, overpayments associated with audited services relative to hospice patients\\' life expectancy cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy to allow for extrapolation of an auditor\\'s findings across a population with sufficient confidence.76 This unique nature of hospice prognostication is supported by several cases, which have noted that extrapolation is inappropriate in the hospice contell.1-. In U.S. ex rel. Michaels v. Agape Senior Cmty., Inc., the court held that statistical sampling and extrapolation could not be used to establish liability since \"each and every claim at issue\" was \"fact-dependent and wholly unrelated to each and every other claim.\"77 The Agape court stated that extrapolation is unsuitable for circumstances where determination of medical necessity or terminal prognosis 7\\' Caring Hearts Personal Home Services, Inc. v.

While extrapolation from sampling may be appropriate where the evidence establishes that a provider\\'s objective approach was similar in all cases, making the sample a reasonable basis for extrapolation to the whole, this is not the case when it comes to determinations of terminality.82 The permissibility of statistical sampling turns on the degree to which the evidence is reliable in proving or disproving the elements of the relevant cause of action.83 Statistical sampling, therefore, cannot be used to establish an overpayment related to alleged ineligible patients, as the underlying determination of eligibility for hospice is inherently subjective, patient-specific, and dependent on the judgment of involved physicians , as discussed above. The OIG\\'s findings that certification or a certain level of care was inappropriate in one patient\\'s case should not be imputable to other claims involving-in addition to different conditions and different physicians -different caregivers, different facilities, and differen t time periods.84 Every hospice patient is entirely unique, and the hospice benefit allows patients to receive an array of services provided by a complex interdisciplina ry team, the nature of such services depending on the individual patient\\'s medical needs.85 Furthermor e, every hospice physician has a unique set of skills and experiences, and, again, courts have recognized that two physicians can disagree concerning a patient\\'s prognosis , and neither physician be wrong. 86 This 78 Id at *8.

In purporting to extrapolate from one claim, the OIG has taken one physician\\'s clinical judgment regarding one patient\\'s terminal prognosis or level of care and applied it to other physicians\\' prognostications for other patients, whose backgrounds and medical needs are each distinct from the sampled patient claim. It is impractical, if not impossible , to extrapolat e properly by accounting for all the relevant variables associated with hospice care. It is inappropriat e, therefore, to extrapolate from one physician\\'s prognostication regarding one patient to another physician\\'s conclusions about a completely different patient.87 Further, although the Act grants permission to use extrapolation in certain circumstances, it does not mandate such use in every type of audit. 88 In other words, the statute contemplates circumstances when extrapolation is neither necessary nor reasonable. In this matter, the Act should not be interpreted to permit use of extrapolation in circumstances where Congress clearly did not intend it.89 Such interpretation would also produce absurd results. If a particular application of a statute produces an absurd result, the courts should and will interpret the statute to reflect what Congress would have intended had it confronted the absurdity .90 The payment model Congress designed for hospices includes many features to ensure that hospices take responsibility for virtually all end of life care for their patients, while providing overall cost-savings to the Medicare trust.91 This responsibility and burden that Congress has imposed on hospices, and that hospices freely accept, is incompatible with the additional, draconian consequences that would result if extrapolation were pe1mitted. In particular, permitting extrapolation in this context would result in groundless overpayme nt determinatio ns that fail to acknowledge either the benefits of individualized care that hospice agencies provide beneficiaries or, more importantly , the concept that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong.92 Furthermore, the Supreme Court, as well as the Fifth Circuit have made clear that sampling and extrapolation cannot always be used to prove liability, and courts are required to engage in a particularized analysis of whether extrapolation from a particular data set can reliably prove the elements of the 87 See id at *13. 88 See § 1893(!)(3) of the Act ( 42 U.S.C. § 1395ddd(f)(3)). 89 Compare § 1879 of the Act to § 1893(!)(3) of the Act 90 The Supreme Court has consistentl y adjusted statutory commands in order to avoid absurd results.

The OIG\\'s Sampling and Extrapolation ofHPBC\\'s Claims are Statistically Invalid. HPBC engaged Dr. R. Mitchell Cox to evaluate the OIG\\'s statistical sampling and extrapolation methodology. Dr. Cox has decades of experience providing independ ent analysis of statistical sampling and extrapolation in the healthcare context.95 He has served as a statistical expert in numerous appeals of overpayment determinations before Administrative Law Judges and in federal courts. Attached as Exhibit 40 is Dr. Cox\\'s Expert Report, which identifies and explains multiple procedural and statistical concerns with respect to the OIG\\'s statistical sampling methodology and extrapolation .96 Each of the flaws detailed in Dr. Cox\\'s report demonstrates that the extrapolat ion is statistically invalid. First, the OIG failed to prove that it used a statistically valid random sample because it did not provide documentation sufficient to re-create the sampling frame or the sample. Specifically, it did not provide documentation showing that the order of claims in the frame was fixed and documented prior to sample selection. The order of claims in a sampling frame should be fixed and documented before the sample is selected to show that the sample was not improperly drawn or manipulated. The failure to fix and document the order of the claims in the sampling frame prior to sample selection means the sample does not conform to basic statistical requirements and is not statistically valid. Here, the OIG\\'s statistician did not provide documentation to support the proper ordering of the sampling frame. Specifically, the OIG failed to provide the sort order of the sampling frame and the random number seed that was used to initialize the random number generator. The former is needed to re-create the sampling frame, and the latter is needed to re-create the sample. Accordingly , it cannot be determined that the OIG drew a statistically valid random sample in this audit and extrapolation . Second, the precision and the confidence level are the two most important parameters for a statistical estimate. To have a standard precision of 10% and a two-sided 90% confidence interval, which the OIG claims it used, a sample size of 530 claims (instead of the 100 claims that the OIG reviewed) would have been required. According to the OIG\\'s own guideline s, the sample here is only 19% of the size that it should have been, and the precision is 23.38% (more than double the standard precision of 10%). Even if an overpaym ent exists, which HPBC denies, this inadequate sample size may mean that HPBC is being asked to significantly over-reimburs e 93 Vista Hospice Care at *13 (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338,367; In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 109 F.3d 1016, 1017 (5th Cir. 1997)). 94 See, generally, supra notes 72-73. 9i Exhibit 41, Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Cox. 96 Exhibit 40, Statistical Expert Report of Dr. Cox. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 50    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 29 the government 133.8% more than it would have had to reimburse if the precision had been 10%, which, again, would have required a sample size of 530 claims. Third, the reason the OIG\\'s sample is too small to yield an acceptable value for the precision is that the OIG sampled by claim and not by beneficiary or episode of care, and claims belonging to the same beneficiary and episode of care are not statistically independent. The OIG\\'s sample size determination procedure fails because its sampling units -claims -are not statistically independent where there are multiple claims belonging to the same beneficiary or episode of care. In this case, a sizable fraction of the beneficiarie s and episodes of care in the OIG\\'s sampling frame had multiple claims, so a sizable fraction of the claims in the OIG\\'s sampling frame cannot be assumed to be statistically independent. The OIG\\'s sampling procedure ignored this fact, resulting in a sample too small to achieve an acceptable value of the precision and possibly resulting in the OIG asking Trustbridge to reimburse much more than it otherwise would. Fourth, the OIG violated statistical principles when it improperly removed potential underpayments from its sampling frame and thereby introduced a bias towards overpayments into its sampling frame and into its sample. In the OIG\\'s sampling plan, the OIG states that zero\\xadpaid claims (potential underpayments) were excluded from the universe. Since the zero-paid claims were excluded from the universe, they were not available to be selected for the sample here and thus did not factor into the extrapolated overpayment. Statistical principles require the inclusion of zero-paid claims in the universe. This exclusion of unpaid and potentially underpaid claims puts HPBC at an extreme disadvantage because it likely resulted in an improperly inflated extrapolated amount that the OIG has deemed an overpayment. There is absolutely no legal, administrative, or statistical justification for the OIG to have removed the zero-paid claims from the universe. Finally, the extrapolation is unfounded because the payment error rate derived from the OIG\\'s review is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolation. The OIG stated in its draft report that \"CMS, acting through a MAC [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or other contractor, will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures.\" The policies and procedures followed by CMS include the MPIM. While HPBC realizes that the OIG is not a Medicare contractor and, accordingly, maintains that it is not bound by the MPIM, the MPIM is a reliable recitation of established statistical principles . Of course, any recoupment amount extrapolated from a sample, including the current one, must ultimately comply with the requirements of the MPIM to be enforceable . Under section 1893([)(3) of the Act, extrapolation is only permitted if the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines there is a \"sustained or high level of payment error.\" Under the MPIM, § 8.4.1.4, a finding of\"sustained or high level of payment error\" cannot be based upon a post-payment review error rate unless the error rate is greater than HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 51    BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 30 50%. From the audit of HPBC by the OIG, the financial error rate (the total dollar amount allegedly paid in error divided by the total dollar amount paid for all claims in the sample) is 0.37 or 37%. Therefore, HPBC\\'s overpayment did not meet the minimum high error rate standard of 50% set out in the MPIM, and the MAC tasked with determinin g whether an overpayment exists will not be permitted to extrapolate. Any one of Conclusions 1 through 5 stands either on its own or in combination with the other conclusions to invalidate the OIG\\'s overpayment estimate. In Dr. Cox\\'s professional opinion, the OIG\\'s Sampling Plan is not an adequate foundation for statistical sampling for overpayment estimation . Therefore, the OIG\\'s estimate for the population is not supportab le under the OIG regulations , Medicare guidelines, and generally accepted statistical principles. 3. The SIA-Related Ovemayments Identified by the OIG Cannot Form Basis of Extrapolation Because the total service intensity add-on (\"SIA\") overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified through a case-by-case review, the SIA overpayments identified by the OIG with respect to three sampled claims cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated SIA overpayment amount. The OIG detenuined that the HPBC received $335.57 in improper SIA payments for sampled claims 63, 70, and 100. Upon investigation, the HPBC found that the root cause of the SIA overpayments was both a Palmetto system error, as well as a technological i ssue within its electronic medical record (\"EMR\") system that inadvertently over-reporte d certain SIA-eligible units on the claims. HPBC is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total SIA overpayment amount for each claim. Once it has completed this quantification, the HPBC will voluntarily refund to Medicare the total SIA overpayment amount for all claims impacted by these issues. Because the total SIA overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified manually and repaid accurately without the use of statistical sampling, the OIG is not permitted to use sampling to extrapolate a total estimated SIA overpayment amount. Statistical sampling may be used to estimate overpayme nts \"when claims are voluminous ... and when a case-by-case review is not administratively feasible. \"97 The justification for and constitutional soundness of statistical sampling rests on it being \"the only feasible method available\" for the government to determine overpayments in some cases.98 Courts have refused, however, to allow statistical sampling when 97 HCFA Ruling No. 86-1 (emphasis added); see also ChavesCnty. Home Health Serv., Inc. v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 914, 919 (D.C.

Accordingly, the OIG should remove from its $42,336,162 estimated overpayme nt the amount that was based on a legally impermissible extrapolation of the $335.57 in SIA overpayments identified in the three sampled claims. D. Liability for the OIG\\'s Overpayment Determination Must Be Waived Under Sections 1879 and 1870 of the Act. Sections 1879 and 1870 of the Act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayment amounts even if the patients at issue were not terminally ill. The Hospice met the requirements for those waivers. Under the Caring Hearts case, the federal Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit described Section 1879 as follows: In seeming recognition of the complexity of the Medicare maze, Congress [in Section 1879] indicated that providers who didn\\'t know and couldn\\'t have reasonably been expected to know that their services weren\\'t permissible when rendered generally don\\'t have to repay the amounts they received from CMS. A sort of good faith affirmative defense, if you wilI.100 Under Caring Hearts, CMS must forgive \"mistakes\" of the provider if the provider\\'s purported mistakes were reasonable and supported the propriety of the services provided. Moreover, section 1879(g)(2) expressly includes mistakes related to determination that a hospice patient is not terminall y ill. Congress specifically added Section 1879(g)(2) to expand this waiver to determinations that a patient is not terminally ill as a means of providing some financial protection for hospices, since hospices must assume a significant financial burden for their patients based on an inherently imprecise clinical judgment regarding whether a patient\\'s terminal illness will follow the nonnal course.101 Similarly, waiver of liability is required under Section 1870 if a provider is \"without fault\" because it \"had a reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was c01Tect .... \"102 To be 99 See, e.g. US. ex rel.

Here, HPBC understandably relied on the reasonable clinical judgment of the patients\\' skilled physicians and had a \"reasonable basis for assuming the payment[ s] [were] correct. \"103 The Patient Response Summaries demonstrate this reasonable basis. The Medical Review Contractor has failed to show that HPBC should have known that its physicians\\' certification would be deemed in error years later or that the physicians\\' certifications or level of care determinations were unreasonable. When viewed in light of the correct standard for evaluating hospice eligibility, HPBC did not and could not reasonably have known or been expected to know that any of the patients under review would be determined years later to not be terminally ill. After all, \"physicians applying their clinical judgment about a patient\\'s projected life expectancy could disagree, and neither physician [] be wrong. \"104 For these reasons, HPBC requests that the OIG address and evaluate waiver under Sections 1879 or 1870 before issuing its final report. E. The OIG Must Include an Offset Based Upon Amounts Otherwise Payable by Medicare. The alleged overpayment identified by the OIG fails to incorporate an adjustment based upon the amounts Medicare would have otherwise paid for these beneficiaries had they not been terminally ill and elected hospice. Such an adjustment is required by long-standing secondary payer and CMS policies105 and dictated by administrative law decisions and subsequent CMS guidance confirming Medicare liability for paying an unbundled rate for services when the basis for denying a bundled payment rate is the location where the services were provided.106 Congress has confirmed that, absent hospice care, the government is otherwise required to pay for \"whatever palliative services are needed to manage [the patient\\'s] terminal illness,\" such as durable medical equipment, pharmacy, radiology , labs, and therapies.107 Any alleged overpayment must be adjusted to reflect those amounts paid for services that would otherwise 10, Id 104 AseraCare, 938 F.3d at 1296.; see also Vista Hospice Care, Inc., 2016 WL 3449833, at *l 7. 105 See Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual (\"MPDBM \"), CMS Pub. 100-18, Ch. 14 § 50.144. CMS has applied this reconciliation policy to hospices, indicating hospices \"are entitled to seek compensation from the Part D sponsor. ... \" See Memorandum from Tracey McCutch eon, Acting Director, Medicare Drug Benefit and C & D Data Grp., to All PartD Plan Sponsors & Medicare Hospice Providers (Mar. 10, 2014). Further, under Medicare secondary payer rules, the primary payer \"shall reimburse the [secondary payer] for any payment... with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\" Act§ 1862(b)(2)(B)(ii). 106 See CMS, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (\"MBPM \"), Pub No., 100-02, Ch. 6 § 10-10.1 (\"[p]ayment may be made under Part B for physician services and for [certain] nonphysician medical and other health services ... when furnished by a participatin g hospital ( either directly or under arrangements) to an inpatient of the hospital, but only if payment for these services cannot be made under Part A\" when the \"inpatient admission was not reasonable and necessary, ... and if waiver of liability payment [was] not made\").

III. Response to Recommendations in the OIG\\'s Draft Report There are three recommendations in the Draft Report: (1) refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure hospice services comply with Medicare requirements. HPBC\\'s position with respect to these recommendations is set forth below. A. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of The Alleged Improper Payments Within the 4-year Claim Reopening Period. HPBC has already voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims with an SIA overpayment (Sample #63 and 100) and is in the process of identifying and voluntarily refunding other SIA overpayments that were the result of a Palmetto system error and EMR system error, including the SIA payment for Sample #70.108 HPBC does not concur with this recommendation with respect to all other claims denied by the Medical Review Contractor.109 HPBC and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the OIG and have determined that HPBC did not receive an overpayment and that the Medical Review Contractor\\'s claim denials and the OIG\\'s statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law with respect to these other claims. The rationale for HPBC\\'s determinati ons is set fo1th in this letter and the Patient Response Summaries prepared by its independent expert physician, Dr. Leedy. If any attempt is made by HPBC\\'s MAC to recoup funds related to the OIG\\'s audit, HPBC intends to exercise all appeal rights available to it. B. Response to OIG Recommendation to Refund of Other Overpaymen ts in Accordance with 60-Day Repayment Rule. HPBC acknowledges its obligations under the 60-Day Repayment Rule. As noted above, HPBC has voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims and will be making further voluntary repayments associate d with SIA overpayments currently being investigated. However, besides claims involving SIA payments, HPBC has determined that no other repayments under this rule are warranted at this time. The Draft Report indicates that the OIG believes its report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments, and, therefore, HPBC must \"exercise reasonabl e diligence to identify overpayments\" for a 6-year lookback period pursuant to the requirements of the 60-day rule in§ 1128J(d) of the Act and 42 C.F.R. § 401.305 applies. As 108 On April 8, 2022, HPBC made a voluntary repayment to Palmetto for service intensity add-on payments received from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. This refund included a repayment of SIA payments for two individuals included in the OIG sample (Samples 63 and 100). 109 This includes all 37 claims denied on the basis of eligibility or level of care. HB: 4860-5834-5255.2 Medicare Hospice Provider Compliance Audit: Hospice of Palm Beach County, Inc. (A-02-20-01001 ) 55     BLACKWELL Ms. Brenda Tierney July 12, 2022 Page 34 noted above, HPBC and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the OIG and have determined that it did not receive any other overpayments and that the OIG\\'s claim denials and statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law. Accordingly , HPBC has met the obligations of§ 1128J( d) of the Act and 42 C.F .R. § 401.305 as set out by CMS in 81 Fed. Reg. 7654 (Feb. 12, 2016). C. Response to OIG Recommendation to Strengthen its Policies and Procedures. HPBC does not concur with this recommendation. As already discussed, HPBC has robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance program, which are shown by a number of CMS data sets to be effective. HPBC\\'s policies and procedures comply with and incorporate the Medicare requirements. While HPBC routinely and proactively takes steps to strengthen its practices to ensure compliance with the everchanging Medicare requirements , it disagrees that any particular flaws exist in its current policies and procedures that allowed ineligible patients to be certified for hospice or allowed provision of unnecessary GIP or CHC care. Moreover, the Draft Report does not identify any particular flaws. To be sure, HPBC has confirmed through an independent expert physician that its claims were appropriate. As noted throughout, the Draft Report is significantly flawed and is indicative of an overzealous, inexperienced Medical Review Contractor. CONCLUSION Thank you once again for the opportunity to present these comments to the Draft Report. We appreciate the work that the OIG has put into this effort, and we respectfully request that the OIG consider these comments in reviewing and revising the Draft Report.

(hpbc ), complied with medicare requirements. how oig did this audit our audit covered 37,121 claims for which hpbc (located in palm beach, florida) received medicare reimbursement of $149 million for hospice services provided from april 2017 through march 2019. we reviewed a random sample of 100 claims . we evaluated compliance with selected medicare billing requirements and submitted these sampled claims and the associated medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services met coverage, medical necessity, and coding requirements . medicare hospice provider compliance audit : hospice of palm beach county , inc. what oig found hpbc received medicare reimbursement for hospice services that did not comply with medicare requirements . of the 100 hospice claims in our sample , 60 claims complied with medicare requirement. however, the remaining 40 did not comply with the requirements. specifically , the clinical record did not support the beneficiary’s terminal illness prognosis (30 claims) , the clinical record did not support the level of care claimed (9 claims) , and services were not supported in the medical record (3 claims) . the total exceeds 40 because 2 claims contained more than 1 deficiency. improper payment of these claims occurred because hpbc’s policies and procedures were not effective in ensuring the clinical documentation it maintained supported the terminal illness prognosis, the appropriate level of care was provided, and that services were supported . on the basis of our sample results, we estimated that hpbc received at least $ 42.3 million in improper medicare reimbursement for hospice services . what oig recommends and hpbc comments we recommend that hpbc: (1) refund to the federal government the portion of the estimated $42.3 million in medicare overpayments that are within the 4 -year reopening period; (2) based upon the results o f this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return overpayments, in accordance with the 60 -day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with medicare requirements. in written comments on our draft report, hpbc disagreed with our findings and recommendations.  specifically, hpbc disagreed with all but 3 of the 40 sample claims questioned in our report. hbpc asserted that our conclusions were inaccurate or divergent from the clinical facts present in the medical records . hpbc also engaged a statistical expert who challenged the validity of our statistical sampling methodology and the resulting extrapolation. after reviewing hpbc’s comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  we also reviewed hpbc’s statistical expert’s comments and maintain that our statistical methodology and extrapolation are statistically valid and resulted in a legally valid and reasonably conservative estimate of the amount overpaid by medicare to hpbc. the full report can be found at https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region2/22001001.asp .                                                                                                  table of content s introduction ............................................................................................................................1 why we did this audit ....................................................................................................1 objective ..........................................................................................................................1 background ......................................................................................................................1 the medicare program ........................................................................................1 the medicare hospice benefit .............................................................................1 medicare requirements to identify and return overpayments ........................3 hospice of palm beach county , inc. ....................................................................4 how we conducted this audit ........................................................................................4 finding s......................................................................................................................................5 terminal prognosis not supported ..................................................................................5 level of care not supported ............................................................................................6 services not supported ...................................................................................................6 recommendations ..................................................................................................................7 hpbc comments and office of inspector general response .........................................7 medicare requirements related to clinical documentation ..........................................9 hpbc comments ..................................................................................................9 office of inspector general response ................................................................. 9 medical review contractor ’s determinations ................................................................. 10 hpbc comments ..................................................................................................10 office of inspector gener al response ................................................................. 11 office of inspector general sampling methodology .......................................................13 hpbc comments ..................................................................................................13 office of inspector general response ................................................................. 13 appendices a: audit scope and methodology ..................................................................................17 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(\"draft report\"). hpbc\\'s comments to the draft report, including the report\\'s conclusions and recommendations , are set forth below.1 introduction hpbc is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in florida, having been established in 1978 by communit y leaders to provide end-of-life care for the area\\'s aging population. its long\\xadtenured leadership team has over 100 years in combined hospice experience. hpbc is one of the oldest non-profit hospices in florida, and it was also one of the first 100 hospices to become medicare-certified. it has also earned the joint commiss ion accreditation for meeting the highest performance standards of care, and it created a nationally-r ecognized hospice and palliative medicine fellowship program for physicians wishing to specialize in hospice care. 1 this letter and exhibits 1-2 and 40-41 do not include any protected health information (\"phi\\'\\'), and therefore we ask that they be attached as an appendix to the oig\\'s final audit report once it is made public. exhibits 3-39 do contain phi, and we ask that these exhibits not be included within the publicly available version of the oig\\'s final audit report. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 appendix e: hpbc comments medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc. (a-02-20-01001 ) 23      blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 2 from a review of only 0.269%2 of the claims for payment that this non-profit hospice submitted to medicare over a two-year period, the oig has concluded that it received an alleged overpayment of $42,336,162. this conclusion is based on a review of limited patient medical records by a medical review contractor retained by the oig to assess whether hpbc admitted patients who qualified for hospice, i.e., had a medical prognosis that his or her life expectanc y is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course, and whether those patients were afforded the appropriate level of care. but, the medical review contractor failed to adhere to the law and standards of practice when reviewing hpbc\\'s claims, and many of its summaries contain factual errors. in response to this draft report, hpbc engaged an independent physician who is well\\xadqualified in hospice medicine to evaluate its patient records and the oig\\'s medical review contractor \\'s assessments of the claims at issue. this independent expert physician has confirmed that hpbc\\'s patient records supported the reasonable clinical judgments of the hpbc physicians who certified that the patients at issue were eligible for hospice and who determined each patient\\'s appropriate level of hospice care. significantly, as with other hospice physicians reviewing similar oig audits, this physician has expressed concern over the apparent lack of understanding of hospice medicine reflected in the medical review contractor \\'s assessments. the contractor \\'s assessments are misleading, incomplete, focus on irrelevant data points, and, most importantl y, fail to provide any explanation regarding how those data points relate to each patient\\'s prognosis. as detailed in these comments, the medical review contractor clearly disregarded numerous hospice principles set out in cms guidance documents . it is our understanding the oig has not independently requested from, nor verified, proof of the qualifications of the physicians or clinicians used by its medical review contractor to review hospice claims. the oig\\'s medical review contractor also failed to apply the appropriate standards for assessing patient eligibility established by the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in united states v. aseracare, jnc.3 specifically, theaseracare court explained that a certifying hospice physician\\'s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only ifno reasonable physician , applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the medicare hospice benefit.4 nothing within the medical review contractor\\'s decisions make this necessary showing. rather, the medical review contractor merely cherry\\xadpicked discrete bits of information to rationalize its decisions while ignoring the patients\\' overall 2 the oig reviewed 100 claims out of the 37,121 claims for 1,556 patients cared for by hpbc from april 1, 2017 to march 31, 2019. of the 100 claims reviewed, the oig has alleged an overpayment with respect to 40 of those claims, which totaled $148,856. 3 938 f.3d 1278 (11th cir. 2019) 4 althoughaseracare arose under the false claims act, the eleventh circuit acknowledged in its decision that its \"primary task on appeal [was] to clarify the scope of the hospice eligibility requirements, which are set out in the federal medicare statute\" and its implementing regulations. id at 1291. accordingly, this standard governs all applications of the medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations, including applications in oig\\'s audit, and is not limited to false claims act cases. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(formerly known as spectrum health, inc.). trustbrid ge is currently the largest provider of hospice care in the area. in 2009, hpbc became one of the only hospices to earn the joint commission \\'s gold seal of approval for home care accreditation, meaning it has met the most rigorous quality and safety standards of care for patients. as a non-profit corporatio n, hpbc is governed by a board of directors, comprised of 10 volunteers from the local community. the members of the board of directors are highly credentialed and are actively engaged in hpbc\\'s efforts to provide quality care in compliance with all state and federal laws. the board is currently chaired by ms. barbara bolton litten, esq. ms. litten has been a business litigation attorney for over 26 years. prior to becoming an attorney, she was the chief executive officer of a large not-for-profit corporation based in southwest florida. she has been a member of the board of directors since 2010. prior to her becoming chair, mr. randy levitt served in that capacity. mr. levitt is a senior vice president at morgan stanley and is both a cpa and attorney. he served as chairman from 2017 to 2021 and remains on the board. two other members of the board are healthcare regulatory attorneys, marian pealman nease and heather miller. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc. (a-02-20-01001 ) 26    blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 5 in addition to its board of directors, hpbc \\'s current leadership team is very experienced in hospice care and active in the industry. mr. david fielding has been the president and chief executive officer since 1998. prior to taking this role 24 years ago, mr. fielding held leadership positions with two other large hospice companies for 9 years. dr. faustino gonzale z, chief medical officer and medical director for hpbc, is board-certified in internal medicine with an added qualification in hospice & palliative medicine. he has also been a fellow of the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine since 2010. he has over 21 years\\' experience in hospice care, and he has published over 13 peer-review articles and has given more than a dozen presentations at various conferences and symposiums on end-of-life and palliative care, including presentations for the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine and the veterans administration. hpbc provides exemplary and compliant care to its patients, evidenced by its gold seal of approval for home care accreditation from the joint commi ssion, and its survey history. hpbc has been continuousl y accredited by the joint commission since 2009. hpbc had no condition-l evel findings on the last two surveys conducted by the joint commission in 2018 and 2022. hpbc is also regularly surveyed by the florida agency for health care administration (ahca), the agency in florida that licenses hospices, which is also the state survey agency for the centers for medicare and medicaid services (\"cms\"). hpbc had no deficiencies representing serious or immediate risk or harm to patients during the time period at issue or after. because of its reputation for providing high quality care, hpbc was able to join in a consortium with the universit y of miami miller school of medicine , jfk medical center, and west palm beach veterans administration center to create a hospice and palliative medicine fellowship program. this fellowship program prepares physicians for board-certification in hospice and palliative medicine and was nationally accredited by the accreditation council for graduate medical education in 2010. as part of a large organization, hpbc has very robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance plan. the oig confirmed during its exit interview that it had not identified any particular flaw or problem with these policies and procedures. the draft report similarly does not identify any specific policy or procedure that is improper or requires modification. rather, the draft report generally indicates hpbc\\'s policies and procedures were ineffective, despite the oig\\'s own statements there were no particular flaw or problem with the policies.8 hpbc\\'s policies and procedures regarding certification of hospice eligibility are based on the federal statutes and regulations, requiring that the physician determine the patient\\'s eligibility 8 the oig\\' s position in the draft report appears to result from the conclusions of the medical review contractor. in other words, the oig has concluded that there must be something wrong with hpbc\\'s policies and procedures because the medical review contractor found reason to deny or down-code certain claims. the oig ignores the more likely explanation: the medical review contractor denied or down-coded claims because the medical review contractor failed to properly apply basic tenets of hospice medicine in a manner consistent with the medicare hospice benefit. see exhibit 1, physician statement of dr. leedy regarding the oig\\'s audit of hospice of palm beach county inc. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc. (a-02-20-01001 ) 27    blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 6 based on the physician\\'s clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the patient\\'s terminal illness. as required by law, hpbc\\'s policies require the physician to prepare a brief written narrative reflecting the patient\\'s clinical circumstances justifying the terminal prognosis , and expressly require that the clinical information supporting the terminal prognosis be documented in the medical record. all of these patients had signed certifications in which their treating physicians attested that they had a terminal prognosis based on those physicians\\' clinical judgment. nothing in the policies and procedures encourages or incentivizes physicians or hospice staff to certify ineligible patients for hospice. to the contrary, the policies make clear that if a patient is ineligible, a more appropriate referral will be made. hpbc has taken steps to implement and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures through regular education of its board members, leadership , physicians, and staff. hpbc has a director of excellenc e and knowledge who coordinates for all physicians and staff necessary training to provide quality care in compliance with the medicare requirements. during the time period at issue, the hpbc physicians were required to attend education on interdisciplinary group meetings and documentation standards, an annual two-part rapid regulatory compliance program through healthstream, which included corporate compliance; and relias llc educational sessions on physician narratives and relatedness determinations. hpbc\\'s other clinical staff also attended the two-part rapid regulatory complianc e program through healthstr eam, sessions on prognosti cation tools and hospice eligibility, and several relias llc educational sessions touching on the medicare hospice benefit and its requirements. physicians and staff alike attend training sessions any time hpbc\\'s policies and procedures are updated. in addition to this training, hpbc\\'s complianc e plan ensures the effectiveness of its policies, procedures, and practices. hpbc\\'s compliance plan is consistent with the oig\\'s guidance9 and memorializes the commitm ent of hpbc\\'s board of directors and all hospice staff to actively participate and uphold the hospice\\'s commitm ent to compliance. board members and hpbc\\'s leadership attend annual training on the compliance plan. there is also a dedicated, full-time corporate compliance officer, who is supported by a compliance department made up of a full-time director of compliance and two full-time compliance nurses. in addition to its full-time complian ce officer and compliance department , hpbc has a compliance steering committee, which provides oversight and direction on regulatory requirement s. the compliance department conducts an annual risk assessment, identifying potential areas of risk using internal audit findings as well as governmental guidance and opinions, to develop an audit plan. it then conducts internal audits based on this plan and frequentl y engages outside consultants to conduct reviews. the results of these reviews are documented, trended, and reported to the compliance steering committe e, ceo, the governance committee, and the 9 see oig, compliance guidance, http//oig.hhs.gov/compliance/compliance-guidance/index.asp. hpbc confinned with legal counsel in 2018 that its compliance plan met both the united states sentencing commission guidelines and the oig\\'s guidelines. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(a-02-20-01001 ) 30    blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 9 the oig extrapolated the error rate for the sample of claims determined by its medical review contractor to the entire universe of claims submitted by hpbc to medicare during the two-year time frame for this audit. as a result of the extrapolation, the oig alleges in its draft report that hpbc received approximately $42,336,162 in improper payments. nothing in the draft report suggests that hpbc acted fraudulently or that it knowingly submitted incorrect information to the government. the oig concludes its report by making three recommendations: (1) refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4-year claim reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with medicare requirements. in the next sections of this letter, hpbc provides its analysis of the draft report and then responds to these recommendations. ii, analysis of the oig\\'s audit process and determinations a. the clinical documentation for the claims reviewed by the medical review contractor met all requirements . hpbc provided properly signed and clinically supported physician certifications and recertifications for each patient whose claim was denied by the medical review contractor. hpbc also provided documentation demonstrating that the patients who received a higher level of hospice care in fact required that level of care. highly trained and experienced physicians signed these certifications and made level of care determinations using their clinical judgment, basing their judgment on the patients\\' conditions. this audit involves rejection of the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians who personally treated the patients at issue, the majority of whom were over 90-years-old. many of these physicians have worked in hospice for years and are board-certified in hospice and palliative care medicine. some of them are fellows in the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine, the highest honor that can be bestowed on a board-certified hospice physician. some of them even teach hospice and palliative medicine. rejecting the clinical judgments of these physicians impugns their expertise and reputation. hpbc engaged an independent physician with impeccable credentials, dr. stephen a. leedy, md, ma, hmdc, f aahpm, to further analyze the medical review contractor\\'s findings and conclusions. 15 dr. leedy assessed the medical records that were provided to the oig and confirmed, as set forth in the individual patient responses included with this letter (\"patient response summarie s\"), 16 that the certifications of terminal illness and the levels of care overpayment amount. once it has completed this quantifica tion, the hpbc will voluntarily refund to palmetto the total sia overpayment amount. 15 see exhibit 2, curriculum vitae of dr. leedy. 16 see exhibits3-39. these exhibits are comprised ofhpbc\\'sresponses to the bases for the oig\\'s claim denials. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(a-02-20-01001 ) 43    blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 22 importantly, none of the relevant language states that the documentary record underpinning a physician\\'s clinical judgment must prove the prognosis as a matter of medical fact. ... nor does this framework state or imply that the patient\\'s medical records must unequivocally demonstrate to an unaffiliated physician, reviewing the records after the fact, that the patient was likely to die within six months of the time the certifying physician\\'s clinical judgment was made.66 in other words, aseracare held that the physician \\'s clinical judgment is the \"controlling condition of reimbursement\" and supporting documentation need not, \"standing alone, prove the validity of the physician\\'s initial clinicaljudgm ent.\"67 if such were the case, the physician certification requirement would be superl1uous. the medical review contractor\\'s analyses and resulting determination s do not reflect the current standard for evaluating the hospice medical record, as set forth in aseracare. the contractor \\'s findings that the document ation did not support patient eligibility or level of care is flawed because the contractor cited only cherry-picked factors tending to support its denials while completel y disregarding other highly probative facts that supported the patients\\' certifications and recertifications and level of care detenninations. identification of a few discrete facts that could only arguably support their conclusions that the patients were not terminally ill or did not require the level of care received-a point that hpbc emphatically rejects-does not satisfy the standard for evaluating documentation under aseracare. at best, the contractor\\'s determinations accomplish nothing more than stating that the medical record supports two divergent opinions regarding terminality, which fails to demonstrate that the patients were certified in error. by ignoring other facts in the record supportin g the certifications and recertifications, the oig medical review contractor applied a much more exacting standard in the course of its review. accordingly, the medical review summari es should be rejected. c. the competency standard: the medical review contractor is not qualified to evaluate the exercise of clinical judgment by the experienced hospice physician s. followingaseracar e, it is clear that the post hoc scrutiny of treating physicians\\' contemporaneous \"properly formed and sincerely held clinicaljudgment[s]\" is not enough to undermine the physicians \\' eligibility determinations . 68 rather, a reversal of certifying physicians\\' hospice eligibility determinations is appropriate only if, based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant medical records, one can conclude that no reasonable physician, applying his or her clinical judgment, could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the 66 id at 1293-94. 67 id at 1291, 1294. 68 aseracare, 938 f.3d at 1297. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(a-02-20-01001 ) 51    blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 30 50%. from the audit of hpbc by the oig, the financial error rate (the total dollar amount allegedly paid in error divided by the total dollar amount paid for all claims in the sample) is 0.37 or 37%. therefore, hpbc\\'s overpayment did not meet the minimum high error rate standard of 50% set out in the mpim, and the mac tasked with determinin g whether an overpayment exists will not be permitted to extrapolate. any one of conclusions 1 through 5 stands either on its own or in combination with the other conclusions to invalidate the oig\\'s overpayment estimate. in dr. cox\\'s professional opinion, the oig\\'s sampling plan is not an adequate foundation for statistical sampling for overpayment estimation . therefore, the oig\\'s estimate for the population is not supportab le under the oig regulations , medicare guidelines, and generally accepted statistical principles. 3. the sia-related ovemayments identified by the oig cannot form basis of extrapolation because the total service intensity add-on (\"sia\") overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified through a case-by-case review, the sia overpayments identified by the oig with respect to three sampled claims cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated sia overpayment amount. the oig detenuined that the hpbc received $335.57 in improper sia payments for sampled claims 63, 70, and 100. upon investigation, the hpbc found that the root cause of the sia overpayments was both a palmetto system error, as well as a technological i ssue within its electronic medical record (\"emr\") system that inadvertently over-reporte d certain sia-eligible units on the claims. hpbc is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify, based on a case-by-case review, the total sia overpayment amount for each claim. once it has completed this quantification, the hpbc will voluntarily refund to medicare the total sia overpayment amount for all claims impacted by these issues. because the total sia overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified manually and repaid accurately without the use of statistical sampling, the oig is not permitted to use sampling to extrapolate a total estimated sia overpayment amount. statistical sampling may be used to estimate overpayme nts \"when claims are voluminous ... and when a case-by-case review is not administratively feasible. \"97 the justification for and constitutional soundness of statistical sampling rests on it being \"the only feasible method available\" for the government to determine overpayments in some cases.98 courts have refused, however, to allow statistical sampling when 97 hcfa ruling no. 86-1 (emphasis added); see also chavescnty. home health serv., inc. v. sullivan, 931 f.2d 914, 919 (d.c. cir. 1991) (stating that courts permit \"the use of statistical sampling to determine whether there has been a pattern of overpayments ... where case-by-case review would be too costly\") ( emphasis added); rio home care, uc v. azar, 2019 wl 1411805, at *16 (sd. tex. mar. 11, 2019) (describing hcfa ruling 86-1 as the \"seminal ruling on the use of statistical sampling to project overpayments to medicare providers\"). 98 see dominion ambulance, l.l.c. v. azar, 968 f.3d 429, 441-42 (5th cir. 2020); see also chaves cnty. home health serv., 931 f.2d at 923. hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

(a-02-20-01001 ) 55     blackwell ms. brenda tierney july 12, 2022 page 34 noted above, hpbc and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the oig and have determined that it did not receive any other overpayments and that the oig\\'s claim denials and statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law. accordingly , hpbc has met the obligations of§ 1128j( d) of the act and 42 c.f .r. § 401.305 as set out by cms in 81 fed. reg. 7654 (feb. 12, 2016). c. response to oig recommendation to strengthen its policies and procedures. hpbc does not concur with this recommendation. as already discussed, hpbc has robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance program, which are shown by a number of cms data sets to be effective. hpbc\\'s policies and procedures comply with and incorporate the medicare requirements. while hpbc routinely and proactively takes steps to strengthen its practices to ensure compliance with the everchanging medicare requirements , it disagrees that any particular flaws exist in its current policies and procedures that allowed ineligible patients to be certified for hospice or allowed provision of unnecessary gip or chc care. moreover, the draft report does not identify any particular flaws. to be sure, hpbc has confirmed through an independent expert physician that its claims were appropriate. as noted throughout, the draft report is significantly flawed and is indicative of an overzealous, inexperienced medical review contractor. conclusion thank you once again for the opportunity to present these comments to the draft report. we appreciate the work that the oig has put into this effort, and we respectfully request that the oig consider these comments in reviewing and revising the draft report. bkn/ems enclosures hb: 4860-5834-5255.2 sincerely, 2a bryan k. nowicki medicare hospice provider compliance audit: hospice of palm beach county, inc.

strengthen its policies and procedures because it believes it has robust policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with medicare requirements  however hpbc did state that it will continue to routinely review and update its policies to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws hpbc asserted that oig’s audit is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects and as a result oig’s overpayment determinations are invalid  specifically hpbc believed that the clinical documentation it submitted for the sample claims met medicare requirements and that oig’s medical review contractor’s denials were inconsistent with hospice regulations and guidance hpbc contended that the medical review contr actor ignored patients’ overall medical condition focused on irrelevant points and “cherry picked” information that resulted in misleading incomplete and inaccurate conclusions hpbc further argued that statistical extrapolation was an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of hospice services because of the individualized nature of each patient’s clinical profile and the subjective and inexact nature of a physician’s level of care determinations prognostication  hpbc engaged a statistical expert who evaluated oig’s sampling and extrapolation methodologies and claimed in a report that even if extrapolation was appropriate oig’s sampling and extrapolation were not statistically valid lastly  hpbc stated that the sia related overpayments found in our sample cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated overpayment amount hpbc also contended that sections 1870 and 1879 of the act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayments even if the associated beneficiaries were not terminally ill as long as the provider has a reasonable basis for assuming the claims it submitted were correct  accordingly hpbc stated that the overpayments identified by oig should be waived because hpbc relied on the clinical judgments of the benefi ciaries’ certifying physicians therefore hpbc had a reasonable basis to believe the medicare payments were correct hpbc also stated that oig’s overpayment must be reduced to offset amounts for items and services eg durable medical equipment phar maceuticals and supplies  that would otherwise be payable by medicare had the beneficiary not elected hospice we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid  we also reviewed the report prepared by hpbc ’s statistical expert and maintain that our sampling methodology and extrapolation were statistically valid and resulted in a

physician confirmed that the certifications of terminal illness and levels of care for beneficiaries associated with our sa mple claims were supported by medical records specifically hpbc stated that the medical review contractor’s analyses were not supported by the medical records contained factual errors and failed to apply fundamental principles or cite relevant medical literature  further hpbc stated that the medical review contractor used similar boilerplate language in its determination letters which hpbc asserted was an indication of the contractor’s failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and to thoroughly review the associated medical records hpbc also claimed that the medical review contractor “ cherry picked ” discrete bits of information to support its decisions while disregarding other facts in the record that supported the beneficiaries’ terminal prognosis lastly hpbc argued that the medical review process was flawed because it only included a review of 1 month of records or less for each hospice patient which does not provide a complete medical picture of a beneficiary’s condition office of inspector general response we maintain that the clinical records submitted by hpbc for the sample claims questioned in our draft report did not meet medicare requirements despite using boilerplate language t he independent medical review

medicare requirement  further contrary to hpbc’s assertion  the medical review contractor did not review o nly 1 month ’s worth of records or less for each hospice patient or “cherry pick” information   rather the contractor evaluated the entire medical record provided by the hospice for each sample claim to determine whether medicare requirements were met this included but was not limited to

contractor failed to apply many wellestablished hospice principles and the appropriate standards governing hospice eligibility specifically hpbc stated that it was improper for the medical review contractor to deny a claim solely on the basis that there was no decline in the beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement hpbc further alleged that t he cont ractor’s determination s were made using the benefit of hindsight and not on the information known at the time the care was provided  in addition hpbc stated that the medical review contractor denied hospice benefits because the contractor relied on a predetermined list of clinical benchmarks that are not required to support a terminal prognosis  further hpbc claimed that the medical review contactor relied on lcds to determine whether a beneficiary met hospice eligibility requirements and that it improperly denied a claim when the ben eficiary’s condition did not meet an lcd as examples hpbc described four sample claims numbers 8 9 72 and 78 for which it believed the associated beneficiaries’ certifications of terminal illness and levels of care were supported by medical records but were considered unallowable by the independent medical review contractor36 lastly hpbc stated that the medical review contractor failed to apply the law consistent with the 2019 unite d states v aseracare  inc decision37 according to hpbc aseracare states that “a certifying hospice physician’s eligibility determination is clinically deficient only if no reasonable physician    could have concluded the patient was eligible for the medicare hospice benefit” and that “medical record supporting a physician’s clinical judgment is not required to prove the validity of that clinical judgment” 36 in exhibits attached to its comme nts hpbc included what it described as “patient response summaries” rebutting the claims denied or partially denied by the independent medical review

contractor failed to apply appropriate medicare hospice requirements ie laws and regulations when conducting its review and that its determinations of terminal status were inconsis tent with hospice coverage requirements as previously mentioned the medical review contractor appropriately applied the standards set out in 42 cfr § 41822b2 to determine whether terminal prognosis was supported  in those determinations the contr actor considered the certifying physician’s terminal diagnosis as well the medical records provided by the hospice for each sample claim guided by questions rooted in the medicare requirements and the clinical knowledge of a licensed physician who specializes in hospice and palliative medicine and is familiar with medicare hospice guidelines and protocols the medical review contractor did not deny a claim because there was no decline in the associated beneficiary’s medical condition or because the beneficiary showed improvement rather it evaluated all clinical conditions presented in the medical records collectively to obtain an overall clinical picture of the beneficiary and based on the information that was available and known at the time of certification or recertification determined whether hospice eligibility requirements were met   we acknowledge that hospice care may still be appropriate for some beneficiaries who did not meet guidelines detailed in lcds based upon an individual assessment of the beneficiaries’ health status  accordingly the independent medical review contactor merely used lcd guidelines as a tool to evaluate terminal prognosis  finally it was the opinion of oig’s medical reviewer contractor that the documentation in the m edical records did not always support the terminal prognosis regarding the four sample claims that hpbc described in its comments as incorrectly determined to be unallowable we note that the independent medical review contractor determined that the associated medical records did not support the terminal prognosis or the need for the level of hospice care provided therefore we mai ntain that the medical review contractor consistently and appropriately applied medicare hospice eligibility requirements specifically • sample claim number 8 hpbc stated that the associated beneficiary had numerous prognos es that impact ed comorbid and secondary conditions  as well as unintentional weight loss however the independent medical review contractor determined that there was no documentation of secondary conditions38 and that the beneficiary had gained weight since admission  therefore the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported • sample claim number 9 hpbc stated that the associated beneficiary had several comorbid and secondary conditions that contribut ed to her terminal prognosis and that she lost 104 percent of her body weight in under 2 months  however the independent 38 such as stage iiiiv pressure ulcer aspiration pneumonia

conditions or ongoing weight loss therefore the terminal prognosis of less than 6 months was not supported • sample claim number 72 hpbc stated that the associated beneficiary required a higher level of care due to labored breathing and elevated heart rate in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain  however the medical review contractor determined that although the medical file documented that the beneficiary was imminently dying and unresponsive the symptoms were being well controlled on scheduled subcutaneous ie not intravenous doses of morphine the beneficiary was not in crisis  therefore the predominance of services provided d id not require nursing support  as a result the continuous home care services provided was not required  • sample claim number 78 hpbc stated that the associated beneficiary’s unstable medical condition and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure required around theclock monitoring by a nurse and frequent administration of several intravenous medication s  however the medical review contractor determined the beneficiary’s medical condition did not warrant a short term inpatient stay for pain control or ac ute or chronic symptom management that could not feasibly be provided in other settings specifically t he medical file did not document that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered  rather medication was administered subcutaneously  which does not require an inpatient setting  therefore the general inpatient care services provided were not required in addition to its exhibits  which include d a claim byclaim rebuttal hpbc’s comments included several examples that according to hpbc demonstrate that the medical review contractor improperly denied claims because beneficiaries’ conditions had not declined or their conditions had improved or st abilized   hpbc stated that the contractor did not base the ir determinations from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided for these examples we maintain that the medical review contractor determin ed that the associated medical f ile did not support a terminal prognosis of 6 months or less or that the level of care provided was required   for example for sample claim number 58 hpbc state d that the medical review contractor denied hospice eligibility for a 90 year old beneficiary who weighed 100 pounds but began to eat all of her meals because she was given an appetite stimulate despite having a primary diagnosis of cerebral atherosclerosis ie a neurological condition for which the lcd does not requir e any weight loss or poor appetite  further the medical review contractor noted that there was no evidence of significant decline  however we note that the medical review contractor also determined that the there was no documentation of secondary condi tions eg stage iiiiv pressure ulcer aspiration pneumonia frequent infections or sepsis   in addition the beneficiary was alert and the documentation supported improved and healing of a stage 2 medicare hospice provider compliance audit hospice of palm beach county

the medical review contractor determined that the medical file did not support a prognosis of 6 months or less we also disagree with hpbc’ s aseracare based assertion that the eligibility determination can be questioned only if no reasonable physician    could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the hospice benefit to the contrary in aseracare  the eleventh circuit rejected the government’s concern that under the court’s reading of the eligibility framework if a physician certified a patient as terminally ill cms would be required to reimburse the hospice provider unless cms could determine that no other reviewer could possibly conclude the patient was terminally ill39 although th e aseracare case was about the circumstances under which certifications of terminal illness could be deemed false for purposes of federal false claims act liability the eleventh circuit clearly acknowledged that cms is statutorily prohibited from paying f or services that are not reasonable and necessary for the palliation or management of terminal illness and that cms retains a well established right to review and deny payments for claims that do not meet that standard accordingly we maintain the validity of our findings  office of inspector general sampling methodology hpbc comments hpbc challenged the validity of our statistical sampling and extrapolation

sampling frame and sample unit randomly selected our sample applied relevant criteria in evaluating the sample and used statistical sampling software ie rat stats to apply the correct formulas for the extrapolation the stati stical lower limit that we use for our recommended recovery represents a conservative estimate of the overpayment that we would have identified if we had reviewed each and every claim in the sampling frame  the conservative nature of our estimate is not c hanged by the nature of the errors identified in this audit moreover the court cases that hpbc ’s attorney referenced in support of the proposition that extrapolation is inappropriate for individualized prognostication in hospices42 are limited to false claims act cases and therefore are inapplicable to

that it be the most precise methodology46 sample size is incorp orated into the computation of the confidence interval with a smaller sample size generally resulting in a smaller lower limit because absolute precision is not required any imprecision in the sample may be remedied by recommending recovery at the lowe r limit which was done in this audit47 this approach results in an estimate that is lower than the actual overpayment amount 95 percent of the time and thus it generally favors the provider48 additionally we disagree with hpbc statistical expert’s statement that the sample unit used for this audit is not statistically independent because oig sampled by claim and not beneficiary the proofs for the unbiased nature of our estimate and the conse rvative nature of the lower limit require random selection of the sample units in this case claims we performed this selection using a valid random number generator  the proofs underlying our methods do not make any assumptions about the distribution of beneficiaries in the sampling frame or in the sample49 we also disagree that oig violated statistical principles by excluding zero paid claims from the universe50 generally oig may perform a statistical or non statistical review of a provider without covering all claims from that provider  further when extrapolation is used oig only projects to the sampling frame from which the sample was drawn  therefore contrary to hpbc’ s assertion a valid sampling frame does not need to include all zero paid claims within the audit period hpbc assert s that any r ecoupment amount

total improper payments because hpbc states it is able to identify all impacted claims and quantify the overpayment through a case bycase review  the estimate presented in this report represents the total amount of all improper medicare payments made to hpbc for hospice services in our sampling frame it does not represent a specific sia overpayment amount  however cms acting through a medicare administrative contractor or other contractor will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures we will calculate any alternate

these claims were extracted from cms’s national claims history nch file we did not assess hpbc’s overall internal control structure rather we limited our review of internal controls to those applicable to our objective our audit enabled us to establish reasonable assurance of the authenticity and accuracy of the data obtained from the nch file  but we did not assess the completeness of the file we performed fieldwork from october 2019 to december 2021 methodology to accomplish our objective we • reviewed applicable medicare laws regulations and guidance  • met with cms officials to gain an understanding of the medicare hospice benefit • had discussions with palmetto officials to gain an understanding of the medicare requirements related to hospice services • met with hpbc’s

conclusions and recommendations  are set forth below1 introduction hpbc is one of the oldest nonprofit hospices in florida having been established in 1978 by communit y leaders to provide endoflife care for the areas aging population its long\\xadtenured leadership team has over 100 years in combined hospice experience hpbc is one of the oldest nonprofit hospices in florida and it was also one of the first 100 hospices to become medicarecertified it has also earned the joint commiss ion accreditation for meeting the highest performance standards of care and it created a nationallyr ecognized hospice and palliative medicine fellowship program for physicians wishing to specialize in hospice care 1 this letter and exhibits 12 and 4041 do not include any protected health information phi and therefore we ask that they be attached as an appendix to the oigs final audit report once it is made public exhibits 339 do contain phi and we ask that these exhibits not be included within the publicly available version of the oigs final audit report hb 4860583452552 appendix e hpbc comments medicare hospice provider compliance audit hospice of palm beach county inc a022001001  23      blackwell ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 2 from a review of only 02692 of the claims for payment that this nonprofit hospice submitted to medicare over a twoyear period the oig has concluded that it received an alleged overpayment of 42336162 this conclusion is based on a review of limited patient medical records by a medical review contractor retained by the oig to assess whether hpbc admitted patients who qualified for hospice ie had a medical prognosis that his or her life expectanc y is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course and whether those patients were afforded the appropriate level of care but the medical review contractor failed to adhere to the law and standards of practice when reviewing hpbcs claims and many of its summaries contain factual errors in response to this draft report hpbc engaged an independent physician who is well\\xadqualified in hospice medicine to evaluate its patient records and the oigs medical review contractor s assessments of the claims at issue this independent expert physician has confirmed that hpbcs patient records supported the reasonable clinical judgments of the hpbc physicians who certified that the patients at issue were eligible for hospice and who determined each patients appropriate level of hospice care significantly as with other hospice physicians reviewing similar oig audits this physician has expressed concern over the apparent lack of understanding of hospice medicine reflected in the medical review contractor s assessments the contractor s assessments are misleading incomplete focus on irrelevant data points and most importantl y fail to provide any explanation regarding how those data points relate to each patients prognosis as detailed in these comments the medical review contractor clearly disregarded numerous hospice principles set out in cms guidance documents  it is our understanding the oig has not independently requested from nor verified proof of the qualifications of the physicians or clinicians used by its medical review contractor to review hospice claims the oigs medical review contractor also failed to apply the appropriate standards for assessing patient eligibility established by the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in united states v aseracare jnc3 specifically theaseracare court explained that a certifying hospice physicians eligibility determination is clinically deficient only ifno reasonable physician  applying his or her clinical judgment could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the medicare hospice benefit4 nothing within the medical review contractors decisions make this necessary showing rather the medical review contractor merely cherry\\xadpicked discrete bits of information to rationalize its decisions while ignoring the patients overall 2 the oig reviewed 100 claims out of the 37121 claims for 1556 patients cared for by hpbc from april 1 2017 to march 31 2019 of the 100 claims reviewed the oig has alleged an overpayment with respect to 40 of those claims which totaled 148856 3 938 f3d 1278 11th cir 2019 4 althoughaseracare arose under the false claims act the eleventh circuit acknowledged in its decision that its primary task on appeal was to clarify the scope of the hospice eligibility requirements which are set out in the federal medicare statute and its implementing regulations id at 1291 accordingly this standard governs all applications of the medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations including applications in oigs audit and is not limited to false claims act cases hb 4860583452552 medicare hospice provider compliance audit hospice of palm beach county inc a022001001  24      blackwell ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 3 medical condition  contrary to federal law and the standards of care and practice recognized by the medical community  contrary to aseracare the oigs medical review contractor failed to give any deference to the certifying hospice physicians resulting in the unsupported conclusion that the clinical judgments made by more than 28 different hospice physicians many of whom have over a decade  or two of hospice experience are boardcertified in hospice and palliative care medicine  and are fellows in the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine 5 were wrong when certifying these patients the majority of whom were over 90yearsold 6 this illogical result is possibly explained by the flawed review process as explained in these comments  the process used by the oig to evaluate medical necessity may work well for most medicare items or services but it is incompatibl e with hospice services likewise  the statistical extrapolation process employed by the oig to convert its review of less than onehalf of one percent of hpbc s claims to an overpayment totaling tens of millions of dollars is unfounded statistical extrapolation is an inappropriate tool to utilize for the evaluation of the practice of hospice medicine because of the individualized nature of prognostication even if ell1rapolation were appropriate the sampling and extrapolation in this matter have been determined by an expert statistician to be invalid for a number of reasons any one of which wanants the oigs reconsideration of its use of the sampling and extrapolation to determine the estimated overpayment the social security act act also supports waiver of the overpaymen ts in this case pursuant to federal law because hpbc submitted the claims at issue in reliance on the clinical judgments of the certifying physicians which are not shown by the oigs medical review contractors summaries to be unreasonable lastly the draft report does not include a required offset based on items and services for which there is no dispute regarding medical necessity such as durable medical equipment pharmacy radiology and labs that medicare is required to cover regardless of whether the patient was terminally ill overall the draft report will significantly decrease beneficiary access to the hospice benefit if it is not reconsidered and revised if hospices and physicians were to use the criteria and standards used by the oigs medical review contractor it will mean some of the most vulnerable medicare beneficiaries will not be able to access hospice care until they are showing signs and symptoms of actively dying which is directly contrary to the intent of congress and cms 7 the active dying process occurs over hours or days whereas the medicare hospice 5 for example six claims denied by the oigs medical review contractor are associated with four physicians who have over 10 years experience and are fellows in the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine two of these physicians also teach hospice medicine a total of 22 claims that were denied involve patients certified by physicians with over 10 years of experience in hospice medicine 6 of the 30 patients denied based on eligibility two were over i 00 years old 14 were ages 9099 and nine were between 8689 years old 7 cms revised the hospice regulations in 1990 to encourage physicians to certify more patients for

be in their last six months of life comfort care in order to maintain their and their families quality of life dignity and peace beneficiaries should not suffer and be denied access to comfort care as a result of an illfitted audit process carried out by an unidentified reviewer whose qualifications and experience are in serious doubt in light of the foregoing and as discussed in detail below the oigs audit is fundamentall y flawed in numerous respects and as a result its overpayment determination is invalid for these reasons we respectfully request that the oig reconsider the claim decisions and the conclusions made in the draft report background information on hpbc the draft audit report is wholly inconsistent with hpbcs history leadership accreditation reputation and culture of compliance as a historical and locallybased nonprofit with its sole mission to provide families in the community with access to compassionate and quality hospice services hpbc has taken all necessary steps to ensure compliance with the medicare program hpbc is a nonprofit hospice that was originally formed by a group of community leaders in 1978 to provide endoflife care for everyone who needed it regardless of their ability to pay or financial status this was before the medicare hospice benefit existed at that time it was one of the first hospices in the area when medicare created the hospice benefit in 1983 recognizing the benefits and costsavings associated with endoflife care hpbc became one of the first 100 hospices to be certified in 2014 hpbc joined together with its sisterlocation hospice by the sea to form trustbridge inc formerly known as spectrum health inc trustbrid ge is currently the largest provider of hospice care in the area in 2009 hpbc became one of the only hospices to earn the joint commission s gold seal of approval for home care accreditation meaning it has met the most rigorous quality and safety standards of care for patients as a nonprofit corporatio n hpbc is governed by a board of directors comprised of 10 volunteers from the local community the members of the board of directors are highly credentialed and are actively engaged in hpbcs efforts to provide quality care in compliance with all state and federal laws the board is currently chaired by ms barbara bolton litten esq ms litten has been a business litigation attorney for over 26 years prior to becoming an attorney she was the chief executive officer of a large notforprofit corporation based in southwest florida she has been a member of the board of directors since 2010 prior to her becoming chair mr randy levitt served in that capacity mr levitt is a senior vice president at morgan stanley and is both a cpa and attorney he served as chairman from 2017 to 2021 and remains on the

industry mr david fielding has been the president and chief executive officer since 1998 prior to taking this role 24 years ago mr fielding held leadership positions with two other large hospice companies for 9 years dr faustino gonzale z chief medical officer and medical director for hpbc is boardcertified in internal medicine with an added qualification in hospice  palliative medicine he has also been a fellow of the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine since 2010 he has over 21 years experience in hospice care and he has published over 13 peerreview articles and has given more than a dozen presentations at various conferences and symposiums on endoflife and palliative care including presentations for the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine and the veterans administration hpbc provides exemplary and compliant care to its patients evidenced by its gold seal of approval for home care accreditation from the joint commi ssion and its survey history hpbc has been continuousl y accredited by the joint commission since 2009 hpbc had no conditionl evel findings on the last two surveys conducted by the joint commission in 2018 and 2022 hpbc is also regularly surveyed by the florida agency for health care administration ahca the agency in florida that licenses hospices which is also the state survey agency for the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms hpbc had no deficiencies representing serious or immediate risk or harm to patients during the time period at issue or after because of its reputation for providing high quality care hpbc was able to join in a consortium with the universit y of miami miller school of medicine  jfk medical center and west palm beach veterans administration center to create a hospice and palliative medicine fellowship program this fellowship program prepares physicians for boardcertification in hospice and palliative medicine and was nationally accredited by the accreditation council for graduate medical education in 2010 as part of a large organization hpbc has very robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance plan the oig confirmed during its exit interview that it had not identified any particular flaw or problem with these policies and procedures the draft report similarly does not identify any specific policy or procedure that is improper or requires modification rather the draft report generally indicates hpbcs policies and procedures were ineffective despite the oigs own statements there were no particular flaw or problem with the policies8 hpbcs policies and procedures regarding certification of hospice eligibility are based on the federal statutes and regulations requiring that the physician determine the patients eligibility 8 the oig s position in the draft report appears to result from the conclusions of the medical review contractor in other words the oig has concluded that there must be something wrong with hpbcs policies and procedures because the medical review contractor found reason to deny or downcode certain claims the oig ignores the more likely explanation the medical review contractor denied or downcoded claims because the medical review contractor failed to properly apply basic tenets of hospice medicine in a manner consistent with the medicare hospice benefit see exhibit 1 physician statement of dr leedy

july 12 2022 page 6 based on the physicians clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the patients terminal illness as required by law hpbcs policies require the physician to prepare a brief written narrative reflecting the patients clinical circumstances justifying the terminal prognosis  and expressly require that the clinical information supporting the terminal prognosis be documented in the medical record all of these patients had signed certifications in which their treating physicians attested that they had a terminal prognosis based on those physicians clinical judgment nothing in the policies and procedures encourages or incentivizes physicians or hospice staff to certify ineligible patients for hospice to the contrary the policies make clear that if a patient is ineligible a more appropriate referral will be made hpbc has taken steps to implement and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures through regular education of its board members leadership  physicians and staff hpbc has a director of excellenc e and knowledge who coordinates for all physicians and staff necessary training to provide quality care in compliance with the medicare requirements during the time period at issue the hpbc physicians were required to attend education on interdisciplinary group meetings and documentation standards an annual twopart rapid regulatory compliance program through healthstream which included corporate compliance and relias llc educational sessions on physician narratives and relatedness determinations hpbcs other clinical staff also attended the twopart rapid regulatory complianc e program through healthstr eam sessions on prognosti cation tools and hospice eligibility and several relias llc educational sessions touching on the medicare hospice benefit and its requirements physicians and staff alike attend training sessions any time hpbcs policies and procedures are updated in addition to this training hpbcs complianc e plan ensures the

department also conducts investigations based on reports it receives through various sources all physicians  staff and volunteers are provided with a compliance hotline number to report concerns related to compliance this tollfree compliance hotline number is maintained by a thirdparty contractor to ensure anonymit y and it is posted throughout the hpbc offices the compliance department also hosts a complianc e and ethics week every november during which staff participate in games designed to educate them on the compliance plan and where or how to report compliance concerns including the compliance hotline all staff members are also asked to review hpbcs conflict of interestcode of conduct policy every year and complete an attestation form that asks staff members to disclose

ongoing staff and physician education and overall culture make it apparent that any issues that occur are aberrant and far from widespread the oigs conclusion to the contrary ignores hpbcs background

draft report in this audit the oig reviewed a very narrow snapshot ofhpbc s overall operat ions as a part of its audit the oig selected a random sample of 100 claims out of the 37121 claims submitted by hpbc for the time period of april 2017 to march 2019 which represents 0269 of the claims submitted by hpbc for that time period the 100 claims selected by the oig were associated with only one month or less of hospice services provided to 100 different hospice patients during that time period hpbc provided hospice care to 12762 medicare beneficiaries and received 149850136 in medicare reimbursement after requesting and receiving records from hpbc for these 100 patients for this one month or less of service the oig then had its medical review contractor review the records the oigs medical review contractor determined that 60 of the claims met all medicare requirements while 40 of the claims did not of those 40 claims 30 were denied because the medical review contractor concluded that records accompanying the properly signed physician certification or recertification did not support the medical prognosis of a terminal illness 7 were downcoded from a higher level of care to the routine home care level of care because although the patient was clinically eligible for hospice services the medical review contractor concluded that the documentation did not support the higher level of care and three were partially denied because the medical review contractor concluded that the service intensity addon sia payment was not supported14 14 as a result of the oigs audit

recommendations 1 refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4year claim reopening period 2 exercise reasonable diligence to identify report and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60day rule and 3 strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that hospice services comply with medicare requirements in the next sections of this letter hpbc provides its analysis of the draft report and then responds to these recommendations ii analysis of the oigs audit process and determinations a the clinical documentation for the claims reviewed by the medical review contractor met all requirements  hpbc provided properly signed and clinically supported physician certifications and recertifications for each patient whose claim was denied by the medical review contractor hpbc also provided documentation demonstrating that the patients who received a higher level of hospice care in fact required that level of care highly trained and experienced physicians signed these certifications and made level of care determinations using their clinical judgment basing their judgment on the patients conditions this audit involves rejection of the clinical judgment of over 28 different certifying physicians who personally treated the patients at issue the majority of whom were over 90yearsold many of these physicians have worked in hospice for years and are boardcertified in hospice and palliative care medicine some of them are fellows in the american academy of hospice and palliative medicine the highest honor that can be bestowed on a

extensive experience with hospice as well as peerreviewed medical literature to which he cites in the patient response summaries17 the medical review contractors decisions for these patients on the other hand are not supported by the medical records are rife with factual errors fail to apply fundamental principles of hospice medicine as recognized by the medical community and fail to include citation to any relevant medical literature the medical review summaries use the same or similar boilerplate language for each claim at issue which is indicative of the contractors failure to apply the appropriate eligibility and level of care standards and thoroughly review the medical records provided by hpbc this approach evidences a resultsoriented outcome approach in which the contractor cherrypicked discrete bits of information to support its denials while disregarding other facts in the record supporting the patients terminal prognoses dr leedy has provided a physician statement expressing his deep disappointment and concern over the lack of understanding of hospice eligibility reflected in the rationale of the medical review summaries18 in his physician statement dr leedy details how the contractors analyses are inconsistent with the standard of practice undermine the purpose of hospice care and are antithetical to the hospice benefit he further describes how the

including osseous defects in her right shoulder and right leg muscle weakness and a coccygeal wound she also required a potent transdermal opioid analgesic for hip and low back pain and she suffered from anorexia eating less than 25 of meals during the denied month of service she exhibited severe nutritional compromise and multiple factors documented throughout the medical record support that she was significantly malnourish ed accordingly dr leedy concluded from his review of the medical record that this patient had a terminal prognosis during these dates of service and was appropriately certified the contractor provided several irrelevant clinical points to support the unfavorable decision many of which indicated a misplaced focus on body mass index bmi which is not required to demonstrate hospice eligibility to the exclusion of other information bearing on terminality specifically the contractor glossed over this patients unintention al weight loss of 46 of her body weight in only 6 weeks her increased contractures and kyphosis that made it difficult to measure her height her dysphagia and her anorexia that impaired her nutritional intake in addition to concluding that this patient was eligible dr leedy opined that the contractor selectively ignored information in the medical record to reach a misguided conclusion  • sample 9 the contractor determined sample 9 who

and several comorbid and secondary conditions contributing to her terminal prognosis notably she had lost 104 of her body weight in under 2 months and was anorexic and cachectic the contractor relied on factually false and immaterial factors in finding her ineligible for example the contractor noted that there was no documentation of ongoing weight loss which is directly contradicted in the medical record and would have been apparent had the contractor not artificially and inappropriately constrained the review to just two days of care similarly despite acknowledging her fast score of 7 a which meets the applicable palmetto lcd guidelines the contractor determined this patient to be ineligible ignoring clinical factors indicating a progression towards 7c and downplaying the significance of her staggeringl y low bmi of just 16 dr leedy concluded that this patient was eligible for hospice services and added that the contractor s woefully inadequate understand ing of the details of hospice eligibility including what appears to be a complete lack of reference to lcd guidelines and evidence of inadequate medical record review calls into questions the validity of the

of care for the unstable vital signs oftachypnea labored breathing and tachycardia  elevated heart rate in addition to frequent medication interventions and adjustments to control her pain notably she died on the final day of the denied dates of service yet the contractor commented that the documentation does not support that she was in crisis to the contrary dr leedys review of the records revealed clear signs of distress including pain and dyspnea which are exactly the situation that warrants chc in fact the care provided in this case is an exemplar of the successful use of chc as the patient was able to die peacefully in her own home • sample 78  the contractor determined sample 78 was not eligible for gip care for dates of service september 18 2017 this 81yearold patient had a primary diaguosis of acute catastrophic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident and a pps of 20 that further declined to 10 on september 3 2017 he was admitted to hospice at the gip level of care following an emergency room visit for a severe stroke and significant neurologic symptoms dr leedy agreed with the decision to initiate gip services because this patients unstable medical condition including worsening tachypnea tachycardia hypotension pain lung congestion and agitation and risk of recurrent stroke and seizure due to the severity of his brain damage required around\\xadtheclock nursing monitoring and frequent administration of several intravenous medications he died on the final day of the denied dates of service the contractor s claim that there is no documentation that any frequent or continuous intravenous medication or drips were ordered or administered is blatantly inaccurate moreover the contractor s comment that as needed medication was required rarely misrepresents this patients fragile condition and the need for frequent intervention according to dr leedy it is incorrect to suggest that this patient was not eligible for gip services because the many medications needed to control his worsening symptoms were promptly scheduled rather than administered on an asneeded basis the irrationality of the abovereferenced claim denials is perhaps explained by the flawed review process hpbcs independent expert physician has expressed concern with the oigs process ofreviewing only one month of records  or less for each hospice patient reviewing documents supporting a single claim may be appropriate for auditing the medical necessity of a single item or service but it is not well suited for hospice which involves prognostication of life hb

medical picture19 and ongoing multidisciplinary treatment conducting a limited review of only one month  or less of a hospice patients records does not provide a complete medical picture of the patients condition to allow for prognostication within the standard of practice dr leedy confirms this in his physician statement although he believes the records reviewed by the medical review contractor adequately supported the patients eligibility and level of care the oig should have sought and reviewed the patients other records ifthere was any doubt concerning their eligibility or level of care compounding this issue is the fact that this limited review was performed by someone whose name and credentials are unknown to the oig taking into consideration the clinical judgment of the original certifying physicians the attached patient response summari es prepared by dr leedy and dr leedys physician statement it is apparent there are flaws in the process used by the medical review contractor which warrants reconsideration of the oigs audit process claim denials and conclusions made in the draft report b the medical review contractors denials are inconsistent with the law and guidance concerning the medicare hospice benefit the medical review contractors determinations regarding the terminal status of the patients at issue are inconsistent with the law governing hospice services and hospice eligibility determinations as described below and in the attached patient response summaries prepared by dr leedy the medical review contractors determinations failed to follow the appropriat e standards and principles governing hospice eligibility when applying the correct standards for eligibility under the medicare hospice benefit it is clear that the beneficiaries were eligible and the level of care was appropriate 1 the medical review contractor failed to apply many of the well\\xadestablished hospice principles the draft report is inconsistent with many wellestablished hospice principles described further below but it is important to note at the outset that the medical review contractors summaries of the records were often factually incorrect as just one example the contractor denied the eligibility of a 103yearold with a primary hospice diagnosis of atherosclerot ic heart disease purported ly because she did not have any documented chest pain or documented pain however the records clearly documente d that this nonverbal patient had generalized pain and analgesics were administered to control it throughout the time period under review20 while these errors have been addressed in the individual patient response summaries we point them out here because they call into question the validity of the entire review 19 see aseracare 938 f3d at 1293

blackwell a terminality does not require a decline in condition ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 14 the absence of decline during a single month under review is not a proper reason to conclude that a beneficiary does not have a terminal illness21 cms has also acknowledged that at recertification not all patients may show measurable decline22 based on cms guidance a federal district court has excluded proposed expert testimony that would have claimed that a patient must show decline to remain eligible for hospice23 despite this well\\xadestablished principle the oigs medical review contractor repeatedly denied eligibility based on the fact that the patient had not significantly declined24 this basis for denial is contrary to the position of cms and what the court in vista hospice care identified as the appropriate interpretation of the hospice benefit moreover these patients actually declined but the contractor still denied their eligibility because the decline was slow or not significant for one patient the contractor acknowledged the patient had declined but indicated the decline was slow in progressing25 for a 90yearold patient with a primary diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma with extrasellar elltension meaning a tumor growing in the pituitary gland in the brain that has extended beyond the gland and into the surrounding tissue the contractor focused on a ct scan that showed the tumor had not grown disregarding the patients nine hospitalizations weight loss falls and a decline in functional abilities evidenced by a decreasing pps score 26 even if decline were required these patients did experience decline during the denied dates of service as detailed in the patient response summaries therefore as a matter oflaw claim denials based merely on

brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 15 b patient improvement or stabilization does not disqualify a person from the hospice benefit cms has long recognized that apparent improvement in an individual s symptoms may not mean that the individuals prognosis has improved27 hospices treat the whole person using a multidisciplinary approach which often results in an improvement or stabilization of symptoms cms has thus acknowledged that it can be difficult to distinguish a sustainable stabilization in a patients condition from the impression of stabilization that could not be maintained by the patient if discharged from hospice this point was reaffirmed inaseracare discussed infra where the court acknowledged that because predicting life expectanc y is not an exact science the medicare framework recognizes that patients with an initial prognosis of terminality can improve over time without losing their right to coverage 28 here however the medical review contractor improperly denied claims based on patients purported improvement or stabilization29 for example the contractor denied patients whose weight remained stable or had improved  failing to recognize that some of the weight gain experienced by these patients had negative prognostic implications 30 as another example the contractor denied the eligibility of a 97yearold patient with untreated stomach cancer because her pain was well managed by the hospice31 however the fact that the hospice was providing the patient with large doses of opioid analgesics to keep her escalating pain caused by a progressive stomach neoplasm in check does not mean her prognosis had improved the contractor also denied the eligibility of a 90yearold patient who weighed only 100 pounds because she was given marino an appetite stimulate  and she began to eat 100 of her meals despite the fact that this patients primary diagnosis was cerebral atherosclerosis  the lcd for which does not require any weight loss or poor appetite32 even if these factors were appropriately interpreted by the contractor to be signs of improvement of the patients prognoses which the hospice denies it remains improper to discharge a patient until the hospice has sufficient evidence that the stabilization or improvement can be maintained if the hospice has sufficient evidence to make that determination it appropriat ely discharges

the medical review contractor improperly made clinical eligibility determinations using the benefit of hindsight rather than evaluating the records from the perspective of the hospice at the time the care was provided the applicable regulation and medicare benefit policy manual make clear that the certification of a patients eligibility for hospice must be based on the patients medical records or examination of the patient at the time of the certification 34 several court cases have overturned denials related to eligibility for certain medicare benefits that impermissibly relied on the benefit of hindsight which of course is always 202035 for example when medicare contractors denied skilled nursing care because the records showed the patient was stable throughout the certification period courts overturned the denials because the services must  be viewed from the perspective of the condition of the patient when the services were ordered and what was at that time reasonably expected to be appropriat e treatment for the illness or injury throughout the certification period 36 further courts have noted that medicare beneficiaries shouldnt have to risk deterioration to their health in order to validate the care theyre receiving37 these same principles equally apply to hospice and are consistent with the cms guidance 38 for many of the patients denied on the basis that they were not eligible the medical review contractor appears to have relied on the fact that certain symptoms were not documented for these patients during the month under review for every patient denied based on eligibility regardles s of diagnosis the contractor cited that the patients did not have documentation of any stage iii or iv pressure ulcers aspiration pneumonia frequent infections  or sepsis none of which are required by any applicable lcd some patients actually experienced these signs or symptoms  but the contractor did not count them because the patient responded to treatment for example one patient was hospitalized twice between january 2018 and april 2018 for pneumonia but the contractor denied his eligibility for the month of june 2018 because he did not have any documented aspiration pneumonia39 for other patients recurrent urinary tract infections did not count as frequent infections to support the patients eligibility because according to the contractor the infections responded to antibiotics40 34 see 42 cfr § 41822b3iii see also cms medicare benefit policy manual cms pub no 10002 ch 9 § 201  see folland on behalf of smith v sullivan no 90348 1992 wl 295230 at 7 d vt sept i

blackwell ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 17 it would have been impossible for the hospice physician to know at the time of certification or even during portions of the monthlong period under review that the beneficiary would not experience these issues or if they were experiencing these issues would respond well to treatment moreover  even the medical review contractor could only know with the improper use of hindsight that for example a patient ultimatel y would not experience these signs and symptoms during the month at issue or the patients symptoms would resolve yet the medical review contractor denied the entire claim rather than define when exactly within that month the failure to experience a specific sign or symptom should result in a change to the patients prognosis41 furthermore  by focusing on these specific symptom s the contractor is not only conducting a hindsight evaluation of the records but is also ignoring other important signs and symptom s relevant to determining a patients terminal prognosis which are described further below and in the patient response summaries based on the foregoing it is clear that the contractor improperly applied a retrospective analysis to the question of each beneficiarys eligibility in direct contravention of cms guidance and case law therefore the denials must be reconsidered and redetermined without the improper use of hindsight  d clinical benchmark s are not required to demonstrate tenninalit y law and guidance has made clear that in enacting the statutory and regulatory framework governing hospice congress and cms were careful to place the physicians clinical judgment at the center of the inquiry and specifically chose not to impose a more rigid set of criteria for eligibility determinations that would have minimized the role of clinical judgment42 indeed the aseracare court explained cms has considered and expressly declined to impose defined criteria that would govern the physician s exercise ofjudgment 43 instead the determin ation of hospice eligibility under medicare is centered on the subjective clinical judgment of a physician as to a patients life expectancy i4 further in 2008 cms proposed a rule that would identify criteria that must be considered in certifying patients as terminall y ill45 but subsequently removed the word criteria however in order to remove any implication that there are specific cms clinical benchmarks in this rule that must be met in order to certify terminal illnessi6 accordingly it is improper to rely on specific clinical criteria to deny eligibility 41 additionally this is yet another instance in which the hospice is being punished for providing good care that prevented patients from having ulcers or infections 42 aseracare 938

set of clinical criteria in order to deny the eligibility of beneficiarie s despite the fact that these beneficiaries showed numerous other signs and symptoms that supported their eligibility for all of the patients denied on the basis of eligibility the contractor cited the purported lack of stage iii or iv pressure ulcers aspiration pneumonia frequent infections  or sepsis regardless of the patients primary diagnosis as if all hospice patients undoubtedly show such symptoms and the lack of such symptoms is proof the person is not eligible because a predetermined list of clinical benchmark s is not required to support a terminal prognosis it was inappropriate for the contractor to rely on the lack of those symptoms as a basis to deny the patients access to the hospice benefit further using such clinical benchmarks without regard to the patients whole condition is inconsistent with clear directives from cms47 it also bears repeating that many of these patients had experienc ed these signs and symptoms but the contractor improperly ignored or downplayed them e lcds are not requirementsthey are safe harbors it is wellestablish ed that local coverage determinations lcds are guidelines not clinical benchmarks or mandatory requirements for hospice eligibility48 indeed they are not binding and should not be considered the exact criteria used for determining  terminal illness49 thus m eeting the clinical criteria in the lcds for the patients primary diagnosis is one path to eligibility under the medicare hospice benefit but hospices may otherwise demonstrate to the mac that the patient has a terminal prognosis 50 each of the oigs medical review summaries cite to an lcd to deny the claims at issue 51 under applicabl e law however meeting an lcd is a basis to approve a claim but failure to meet an lcd is not a basis to deny a claim the medical review summaries fail to make a critical and necessary determina tion ie that the medical record for the patient

determinations referenced in the draft report are inconsistent with the central holdings of aseracare52 a landmark decision of the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit which identified the governing standards for evaluating hospice eligibility determinations hpbc is located within the jurisdiction of the eleventh circuit andaseracare is the governing law for hpbc and for the federal government in that jurisdiction as noted earlier althoughaseracare arose under the false claims act the standards set out in the decision applies to all applications of the medicare hospice eligibility laws and regulations53 based on a comprehensive analysis of this legal framewor the aseracare court expounded upon three standards that govern any audit of hospice services including the present one  1 a clinical standard which holds that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patients terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong 2 a documentation standard which requires only that the medical record support the physician s clinical determination as to hospice eligibility rather than prove the determination as a matter of medical fact and 3 a competency standard which permits a later reversal of certifying physicians hospice eligibility determinations only if a competent reviewer ie a qualified physician  finds that no reasonable physician applying his or her clinical judgment could have concluded that the patient was hospice eligible here the medical review contractors analysis falls short of all three of these standards a the clinical standard the medical review contractor improperly based its determinations on a reasonable disagreement with the hospice physicians in its decision the aseracare court made clear that the clinical judgment of the patients attending physician or the providers medical director as the case may be lies at the center of the eligibility inquiry 54 the court further recognized cmss rulemaking commentary signals that wellfounded clinical judgments should be granted deference and  the law is designed to give physicians meaningful latitude to make informed judgments without fear that those judgments will be secondguessed after the fact by laymen in a liability proceeding 55 52 938 f3d 1278 i ith cir 2019  see supra note 3 54 id at 1293 55 id at 1295 hb 4860583452552 medicare hospice provider compliance

a clinical judgment regarding a patients prognosis is invalid or illegitimate merely because an unaffiliated physician reviewing the relevant records after the fact disagrees with that clinical judgment 56 theaseracare courts holding is consistent with congress and cmss prior acknowledgment of the hospice physicians central role and the complexitie s and uncertainties involved in prognostication cms has acknowledged that it is the physicians responsibi lity to assess the patients medical condition and determine if the patient can be certified as terminall y ill57 the recognition of the hospice physicians central role both by cms and the court in aseracare is consistent with other cases requiring extra weight or deference be given to a treating physician s contemporaneous informed opinion unless there is a reasoned basis for declining to do so 58 cms has also long recognized that a terminal prognosis is far from a guarantee of death within six months and some patients have the good fortune to live longer than predicted by a wellintentioned physician59 the fact that a beneficiary lives longer than expected in itself is not cause to terminate benefits60 because prognostication is not an exact science hospice physicians do not need to prognosticate with 100 certainty to establish a patients eligibility for hospice rather cms has stated that eligibility for hospice exists for patients whose clinical status is more likely than not to result in a life expectancy of six months or less 61 congress confirmed this approach to hospice eligibility when it eliminated the 210day limit on the medicare hospice benefit 62 theaseracare court also recognized that predicting life expectancy is not an exact science and no certitude can be expected of physicians in the practice of treating endoflife illness 63 as a result the court concluded that there are vagaries in prognostica tion that can lead to divergent yet equally valid and supported  predictions of life expectanc y the court did not consider it appropriate or a valid application of the medicare hospice benefit to allow a mere difference of opinion between clinicians to result in an adverse consequence for the hospice if anything the hospice physician is entitled to meaningful latitude in his or her prognostication s 64 6 id at 1296 57 70 fed reg at 70539 8 exec dir

eligibility and neither would be wrong accordingly a later reversal of a certifying physicians hospice eligibility determination is appropriate only ifno reasonable physician applying his or her clinical judgment could have concluded that the patient was eligible for the medicare hospice benefit this standard gives appropriate deference to the certifying physicians as required by the hospice legal framework and in numerous other cases nowhere in the draft report nor in its enclosed documentation  did the oig reference the appropriate standard described inaseracare or even identify any standard its contractor used for the afterthefact evaluation of the hospice physicians  clinical judgment the medical review contractor does not indicate at any point in its medical review summari es that no reasonable physician could have certified the patients as hospiceeligible rather the medical review contractor has shown at best that based on its post hoc review of certain records it merely disagreed with the clinical judgment of the skilled and experienced physicians who ce1tified the patients as terminally ill based on the totality of the patients circumstances and the physician s best medical judgments regarding what they expected to happen in the normal course of the patients terminal illnesses likewise the medical review summaries do not set forth a reasoned basis for declining to give weight or deference to the certifying physicians under aseracare that is not enough to refute the hospice physicians  equally reasonable conclusion reached based on the physicians clinical judgment at the time they were treating the patients that the patients had a terminal prognosis the oig cannot base its draft report only on a reasonable disagreement between the physicians who certified and recertified these patients ie the physicians who actually cared for the patients and appropriately applied their clinical judgment to make eligibility determinations  and its medical review contractor who reviewed those certification s years later the law requires more yet the medical review summaries fail to provide it b the documentation standard the medical review contractor improperly demanded that the medical record prove rather than support a patients terminal prognosis the aseracare court recognized that under the plain language of the medicare statute and implementing regulations  a patient is eligible for the medicare hospice benefit if the appropriate physician makes a clinical judgment that the patient is terminally ill in light of the patients complete medical picture as evidenced by the patients medical records65 however  the court held that the medical record supportin g the physician s clinical judgment is not required to prove the

brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 22 importantly none of the relevant language states that the documentary record underpinning a physicians clinical judgment must prove the prognosis as a matter of medical fact  nor does this framework state or imply that the patients medical records must unequivocally demonstrate to an unaffiliated physician reviewing the records after the fact that the patient was likely to die within six months of the time the certifying physicians clinical judgment was made66 in other words aseracare held that the physician s clinical judgment is the controlling condition of reimbursement and supporting documentation need not standing alone prove the validity of the physicians initial clinicaljudgm ent67 if such were the case the physician certification requirement would be superl1uous the medical review contractors analyses and resulting determination s do not reflect the current standard for evaluating the hospice medical record as set forth in aseracare the contractor s findings that the document ation did not support patient eligibility or level of care is flawed because the contractor cited only cherrypicked factors tending to support its denials while completel y disregarding other highly probative facts that supported the patients certifications and recertifications and level of care detenninations identification of a few discrete facts that could only arguably support their conclusions that the patients were not terminally ill or did not require the level of care receiveda point that hpbc emphatically rejectsdoes not satisfy the standard for evaluating documentation under aseracare at best the contractors determinations accomplish nothing more than stating that the medical record supports two divergent opinions regarding terminality which fails to demonstrate that the patients were certified in error by ignoring other facts in the record supportin g the certifications and recertifications the oig medical review contractor applied a much more exacting standard in the course of its review accordingly the medical review summari es should be rejected c the competency standard the medical review contractor is not qualified to

sincerely held clinicaljudgments is not enough to undermine the physicians  eligibility determinations  68 rather a reversal of certifying physicians hospice eligibility determinations is appropriate

it is difficult to fathom how the oig can find a completely anonymous reviewer more credible than the certifying physicians and dr leedy who are highly experienced in hospice and wellcredentialed dr

principles and connect them to the patients results in arbitrary and capricious determinations by the oig75 c the extrapolation of the alleged overpaym ent here is invalid and inappropriate  we ask that the oig reconsider its use of sampling and extrapolation to arrive at the estimated overpayment here for at least two reasons first extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating overpayments in the hospice context due to the individualized nature of prognostication second the oigs statistical methodology was fundamentally flawed and the extrapolated overpayment amount is statistically invalid 1 extrapolation is not appropriate for calculating hospice overpayments given the individuali zed nature of prognostication the oigs attempted calculation of an overpayment amount through statistical sampling and extrapolation fails to take into consideration the unique nature of hospice including each hospice patients relevant clinical profile and the subjective and inexact nature of each hospice physicians prognostication such an attempted calculation premised on clinical eligibility for hospice cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimated overpayment the definitions of eligibility for hospice care are not operationally defined because of the need for subjective clinical judgments by individual physicians in the hospice context consequently overpayments associated with audited services relative to hospice patients life expectancy cannot be measured with sufficient accuracy to allow for extrapolation of an auditors findings across a population with sufficient confidence76 this unique nature of hospice prognostication is supported by several cases which have noted that extrapolation is inappropriate in the hospice contell1 in us ex rel michaels v agape

requires a highly factintensive inquiry and review of each individual patients medical record78 where the nature of the claim requires an individualized determinat ion that determinati on cannot be replaced by trial by formula79 furthermore  the vista hospice care court acknowledged that the permissibilit y of statistical sampling and extrapolation turns on the degree to which the evidence is reliable in proving or disproving the elements of the relevant cause of action80 as both the agape and vista hospice care courts recognized answering whether certain services furnished to hospice patients were medically necessary is not a question for which extrapolation can be an effective tool due to the absolute individuality of each claim for hospice services 81 the aseracare decision further supports the conclusions of agape and vista hospice care since it recognized that vagaries of prognostication can lead to divergent yet equally valid and supported predictions oflife expectancy while extrapolation from sampling may be appropriate where the evidence establishes that a providers objective approach was similar in all cases making the sample a reasonable basis for extrapolation to the whole this is not the case when it comes to determinations of terminality82 the permissibility of statistical sampling turns on the degree to which the evidence is reliable in proving or disproving the elements of the relevant cause of action83 statistical sampling therefore cannot be used to establish an overpayment related to alleged ineligible patients as the underlying determination of eligibility for hospice is inherently subjective patientspecific and dependent on the judgment of involved physicians  as discussed above the oigs findings that certification or a certain level of care was inappropriate in one patients case should not be imputable to other claims involvingin addition to different conditions and different physicians different caregivers

recognized variability in clinical judgment  which variability is entirely appropriate between reasonable physicians eliminate s the predictabilit y of the outcome of a medical record review that is essential to a valid extrapolation in purporting to extrapolate from one claim the oig has taken one physicians clinical judgment regarding one patients terminal prognosis or level of care and applied it to other physicians prognostications for other patients whose backgrounds and medical needs are each distinct from the sampled patient claim it is impractical if not impossible  to extrapolat e properly by accounting for all the relevant variables associated with hospice care it is inappropriat e therefore to extrapolate from one physicians prognostication regarding one patient to another physicians conclusions about a completely different patient87 further although the act grants permission to use extrapolation in certain circumstances it does not mandate such use in every type of audit 88 in other words the statute contemplates circumstances when extrapolation is neither necessary nor reasonable in this matter the act should not be interpreted to permit use of extrapolation in circumstances where congress clearly did not intend it89 such interpretation would also produce absurd results if a particular application of a statute produces an absurd result the courts should and will interpret the statute to reflect what congress would have intended had it confronted the absurdity 90 the payment model congress designed for hospices includes many features to ensure that hospices take responsibility for virtually all end of life care for their patients while providing overall costsavings to the medicare trust91 this responsibility and burden that congress has imposed on hospices and that hospices freely accept is incompatible with the additional draconian consequences that would result if extrapolation were pe1mitted in particular permitting extrapolation in this context would result in groundless overpayme nt determinatio ns that fail to acknowledge either the benefits of individualized care that hospice agencies provide beneficiaries or more importantly  the concept that two physicians using their clinical judgment about a patients terminal prognosis could disagree and neither be wrong92 furthermore the supreme court as well as the fifth circuit have made

mitchell cox to evaluate the oigs statistical sampling and extrapolation methodology dr cox has decades of experience providing independ ent analysis of statistical sampling and extrapolation in the healthcare context95 he has served as a statistical expert in numerous appeals of overpayment determinations before administrative law judges and in federal courts attached as exhibit 40 is dr coxs expert report which identifies and explains multiple procedural and statistical concerns with respect to the oigs statistical sampling methodology and extrapolation 96 each of the flaws detailed in dr coxs report demonstrates that the extrapolat ion is statistically invalid first the oig failed to prove that it used a statistically valid random sample because it did not provide documentation sufficient to recreate the sampling frame or the sample specifically it did not provide documentation showing that the order of claims in the frame was fixed and documented prior to sample selection the order of claims in a sampling frame should be fixed and documented before the sample is selected to show that the sample was not improperly drawn or manipulated the failure to fix and document the order of the claims in the sampling frame prior to sample selection means the sample does not conform to basic statistical requirements and is not statistically valid here the oigs statistician did not provide documentation to support the proper ordering of the sampling frame specifically the oig failed to provide the sort order of the sampling frame and the random number seed that was used to initialize the random number generator the former is needed to recreate the sampling frame and the latter is needed to recreate the sample accordingly  it cannot be determined that the oig drew a statistically valid random sample in this audit and extrapolation  second the precision and the confidence level are the two most important parameters for a statistical estimate to have a standard precision of 10 and a twosided 90 confidence interval which the oig claims it used a sample size of 530 claims instead of the 100 claims that the oig reviewed would have been required according to the oigs own guideline s the sample here is only 19 of the size that it should have been and the precision is 2338 more than double the standard precision of 10 even if an overpaym ent exists which hpbc denies this inadequate sample size may mean that hpbc is being asked to significantly overreimburs e 93 vista hospice care at 13 citing walmart stores inc v dukes 564 us 338367 in re chevron usa inc

been 10 which again would have required a sample size of 530 claims third the reason the oigs sample is too small to yield an acceptable value for the precision is that the oig sampled by claim and not by beneficiary or episode of care and claims belonging to the same beneficiary and episode of care are not statistically independent the oigs sample size determination procedure fails because its sampling units claims are not statistically independent where there are multiple claims belonging to the same beneficiary or episode of care in this case a sizable fraction of the beneficiarie s and episodes of care in the oigs sampling frame had multiple claims so a sizable fraction of the claims in the oigs sampling frame cannot be assumed to be statistically independent the oigs sampling procedure ignored this fact resulting in a sample too small to achieve an acceptable value of the precision and possibly resulting in the oig asking trustbridge to reimburse much more than it otherwise would fourth the oig violated statistical principles when it improperly removed potential underpayments from its sampling frame and thereby introduced a bias towards overpayments into its sampling frame and into its sample in the oigs sampling plan the oig states that zero\\xadpaid claims potential underpayments were excluded from the universe since the zeropaid claims were excluded from the universe they were not available to be selected for the sample here and thus did not factor into the extrapolated overpayment statistical principles require the inclusion of zeropaid claims in the universe this exclusion of unpaid and potentially underpaid claims puts hpbc at an extreme disadvantage because it likely resulted in an improperly inflated extrapolated amount that the oig has deemed an overpayment there is absolutely no legal administrative or statistical justification for the oig to have removed the zeropaid claims from the universe finally the extrapolation is unfounded because the payment error rate derived from the oigs review is not high enough to permit the use of extrapolation the oig stated in its draft report that cms acting through a mac medicare administrative contractor or other contractor will determine whether overpayments exist and will recoup any overpayments consistent with its policies and procedures the policies and procedures followed by cms include the mpim while hpbc realizes that the oig is not a medicare contractor and accordingly maintains that it is not bound by the mpim the mpim is a reliable recitation of established statistical principles  of course any recoupment amount extrapolated from a sample including the current one must ultimately comply with the requirements of the mpim to be enforceable  under section 18933 of the act extrapolation is only permitted if the secretary of the department of health and human services determines there is a sustained or high level of payment error under the mpim § 8414 a finding ofsustained or high level of payment error cannot be based upon a postpayment review error rate unless the error rate is greater than hb 4860583452552 medicare hospice provider

amount allegedly paid in error divided by the total dollar amount paid for all claims in the sample is 037 or 37 therefore hpbcs overpayment did not meet the minimum high error rate standard of 50 set out in the mpim and the mac tasked with determinin g whether an overpayment exists will not be permitted to extrapolate any one of conclusions 1 through 5 stands either on its own or in combination with the other conclusions to invalidate the oigs overpayment estimate in dr coxs professional opinion the oigs sampling plan is not an adequate foundation for statistical sampling for overpayment estimation  therefore the oigs estimate for the population is not supportab le under the oig regulations  medicare guidelines and generally accepted statistical principles 3 the siarelated ovemayments identified by the oig cannot form basis of extrapolation because the total service intensity addon sia overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified through a casebycase review the sia overpayments identified by the oig with respect to three sampled claims cannot be used to estimate an extrapolated sia overpayment amount the oig detenuined that the hpbc received 33557 in improper sia payments for sampled claims 63 70 and 100 upon investigation the hpbc found that the root cause of the sia overpayments was both a palmetto system error as well as a technological i ssue within its electronic medical record emr system that inadvertently overreporte d certain siaeligible units on the claims hpbc is able to identify all impacted claims in the sampling frame and quantify based on a casebycase review the total sia overpayment amount for each claim once it has completed this quantification the hpbc will voluntarily refund to medicare the total sia overpayment amount for all claims impacted by these issues because the total sia overpayment amount in the sampling frame can be quantified manually and repaid accurately without the use of statistical sampling the oig is not permitted to use sampling to extrapolate a total estimated sia overpayment amount statistical sampling may be used to estimate overpayme nts when claims are voluminous  and when a casebycase review is not administratively feasible 97 the justification for and constitutional soundness of statistical sampling rests on it being the only feasible method available for the government to determine overpayments in some cases98 courts have refused however to allow statistical sampling when 97 hcfa ruling no 861 emphasis added see also chavescnty home health serv inc v sullivan 931 f2d 914 919 dc cir 1991 stating that courts permit the use of statistical sampling to determine whether there has been a pattern of overpayments  where casebycase review would be too costly  emphasis added rio home care uc v azar 2019 wl 1411805 at 16 sd tex mar 11 2019 describing hcfa ruling 861 as the seminal ruling on the use of statistical sampling to project overpayments to medicare providers 98 see

county inc a022001001  52    blackwell ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 31 it is not the only method available to establish overpayment for example when discrete claims can be analyzed and reviewed to determine whether they were billed in error99 here since case\\xadbycase review is administratively feasible and statistical sampling is not the only method available to determine overpayment  statistical sampling and extrapolation is inappropriate and not permissible accordingly the oig should remove from its 42336162 estimated overpayme nt the amount that was based on a legally impermissible extrapolation of the 33557 in sia overpayments identified in the three sampled claims d liability for the oigs overpayment determination must be waived under sections 1879 and 1870 of the act sections 1879 and 1870 of the act provide for the waiver of alleged overpayment amounts even if the patients at issue were not terminally ill the hospice met the requirements for those waivers under the caring hearts case the federal court of appeals for the tenth circuit described section 1879 as follows in seeming recognition of the complexity of the medicare maze congress in section 1879 indicated that providers who didnt know and couldnt have reasonably been expected to know that their services werent permissible when rendered generally dont have to repay the amounts they received from cms a sort of good faith affirmative defense if you wili100 under caring hearts cms must forgive mistakes of the provider if the providers purported mistakes were reasonable and supported the propriety of the services provided moreover section 1879g2 expressly includes mistakes related to determination that a hospice patient is not terminall y ill congress specifically added section 1879g2 to expand this waiver to determinations that a patient is not terminally ill as a means of providing some financial protection for hospices since hospices must assume a significant financial burden for their patients based on an inherently imprecise clinical judgment regarding whether a patients terminal illness will follow the nonnal course101 similarly waiver of liability is required under section 1870 if a provider is without fault because it had a reasonable basis for assuming that the payment was c01tect  102 to be 99 see eg us ex rel michaels v agape senior cmty inc 2015 wl 3903675

reasonable ie that it had a reasonable basis for its assumption regarding payment here hpbc understandably relied on the reasonable clinical judgment of the patients skilled physicians and had a reasonable basis for assuming the payment s were correct 103 the patient response summaries demonstrate this reasonable basis the medical review contractor has failed to show that hpbc should have known that its physicians certification would be deemed in error years later or that the physicians certifications or level of care determinations were unreasonable when viewed in light of the correct standard for evaluating hospice eligibility hpbc did not and could not reasonably have known or been expected to know that any of the patients under review would be determined years later to not be terminally ill after all physicians applying their clinical judgment about a patients projected life expectancy could disagree and neither physician  be wrong 104 for these reasons hpbc requests that the oig address and evaluate waiver under sections 1879 or 1870 before issuing its final report e the oig must include an offset based upon amounts otherwise payable by medicare the alleged overpayment identified by the oig fails to incorporate an adjustment based upon the amounts medicare would have otherwise paid for these beneficiaries had they not been terminally ill and elected hospice such an adjustment is required by longstanding secondary payer and cms policies105 and dictated by administrative law decisions and subsequent cms guidance confirming medicare liability for paying an unbundled rate for services when the basis for denying a bundled payment rate is the location where the services were provided106 congress has confirmed that absent hospice care the government is otherwise required to pay for whatever palliative services are needed to manage the patients terminal illness such as durable medical equipment pharmacy radiology  labs and therapies107

response to recommendations in the oigs draft report there are three recommendations in the draft report 1 refund the portion of the alleged overpayment that is within the 4year claim reopening period 2 exercise reasonable diligence to identify report and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60day rule and 3 strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure hospice services comply with medicare requirements hpbcs position with respect to these recommendations is set forth below a response to oig recommendation to refund of the alleged improper payments within the 4year claim reopening period hpbc has already voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims with an sia overpayment sample 63 and 100 and is in the process of identifying and voluntarily refunding other sia overpayments that were the result of a palmetto system error and emr system error including the sia payment for sample 70108 hpbc does not concur with this recommendation with respect to all other claims denied by the medical review contractor109 hpbc and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the oig and have determined that hpbc did not receive an overpayment and that the medical review contractors claim denials and the oigs statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law with respect to these other claims the rationale for hpbcs determinati ons is set fo1th in this letter and the patient response summaries prepared by its independent expert physician dr leedy if any attempt is made by hpbcs mac to recoup funds related to the oigs audit hpbc intends to exercise all appeal rights available to it b response to oig recommendation to refund of other overpaymen ts in accordance with 60day repayment rule hpbc acknowledges its obligations under the 60day repayment rule as noted above hpbc has voluntarily refunded amounts received for two claims and will be making further voluntary repayments associate d with sia overpayments currently being investigated however besides claims involving sia payments hpbc has determined that no other repayments under this rule are warranted at this time the draft report indicates that the oig believes its report constitutes credible information of potential overpayments and therefore hpbc must exercise reasonabl e diligence to identify overpayments for a 6year lookback period pursuant to the requirements of the 60day rule in§ 1128jd of the act and 42 cfr § 401305 applies as 108 on april 8 2022 hpbc made a voluntary repayment to palmetto for service intensity addon payments received from april 1 2017 to march 31 2019 this refund included a repayment of sia payments for two individuals included in the oig sample samples 63 and 100 109 this includes all 37 claims denied on the basis of eligibility or level of care hb 4860583452552 medicare hospice provider compliance audit hospice of palm beach county inc a022001001  55     blackwell ms brenda tierney july 12 2022 page 34 noted above hpbc and its expert physician have thoroughly reviewed the audit findings by the oig and have determined that it did not receive any other overpayments and that the oigs claim denials and statistical extrapolation are improper and contrary to law accordingly  hpbc has met the obligations of§ 1128j d of the act and 42 cf r § 401305 as set out by cms in 81 fed reg 7654 feb 12 2016 c response to oig recommendation to strengthen its policies and procedures hpbc does not concur with this recommendation as already discussed hpbc has robust policies and procedures and corporate compliance program which are shown by a number of cms data sets to be effective hpbcs policies and procedures comply with and incorporate the medicare requirements while hpbc routinely and proactively takes steps to strengthen its practices to ensure compliance with the everchanging medicare requirements  it disagrees that any particular flaws exist in its current policies and procedures that allowed ineligible patients to be certified for hospice or allowed provision of unnecessary gip or chc care moreover the draft report does not identify any particular flaws to be sure hpbc has confirmed through an independent expert physician that its claims were appropriate as noted throughout the draft report is significantly flawed and is indicative of an overzealous inexperienced medical review contractor conclusion thank you once again for the opportunity to present these comments to the draft report we appreciate the work that the oig has put into this effort and we respectfully request that the oig consider these comments in reviewing and revising the draft report bknems enclosures hb 4860583452552 sincerely 2a bryan k nowicki medicare hospice provider
